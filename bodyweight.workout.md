## 1. Press-Ups

![image](https://hips.hearstapps.com/ame-prod-menshealth-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/main/assets/press-up_animated.gif?resize=480:*
"image")

### How to do the exercise

* Set up with your weight supported on your toes and hands beneath your 
shoulders, body straight.
* Take care to keep your core locked so a straight line forms between your
head, glutes and heels.
* Lower your body until your chest is an inch from the ground then explosively 
drive up by fully extending your arms.

### Why?

Pressed for time? Perform 20 reps of this classic fat-burner. “This age-old
exercise activates every muscle in your body when performed correctly,” says
personal trainer Bobby Windebank. And how do you get it right? “Just ensure
your hands are an equal distance apart and directly underneath your shoulders.
Squeeze your glutes and abs too. That’ll create body tension to maximise
efficiency during the execution of the exercise.”

## 2. Step-Up With Knee Raises

![image](https://hips.hearstapps.com/ame-prod-menshealth-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/main/assets/stepupknee.gif?resize=480:*
"image")

### How to do the exercise

* Place a bench or a box in front of you and step onto it with one foot.
* As you plant your foot, drive with your other foot bringing your knee up as 
high as you can. Lower it back down and step back onto the floor.
* Repeat on the other side.

### Why?

Whether you’ve noticed a slight muscle imbalance in your legs or you’re simply
trying to carve some serious lower-body strength, stop fretting: this is the
move for you.

“Unilateral (single leg) training can help strengthen stabilising muscles and
can be used to even out imbalances,” says Windebank. Your left side weaker than
your right? Give it a leg up by dedicating an extra 15 reps to your frailer
pin.

## 3. Groiners

"image")

### How to do the exercise

* Start the exercise in a press-up position.
* Jump forward so both legs land next to your hands.
* Return to starting position.

### Why?

Horrible name, brilliant warm-up exercise. Opening up your hips and thoracic
region massively increases your body’s range of movement (the distance the
muscle extends and contracts during an exercise), according to Windebank. So
what? Well, perform these exercises through a larger ROM and you’ll garner
significant extra muscle growth from your workout.

But that’s not all. This dynamic stretch also pumps blood to almost all the
muscles in your lower-body, drastically decreasing your risk of injury from
overstrain while upping your heart rate for the next muscle-building moves.

## 4. Spider Crawl

"image")

### How to do the exercise

* From a press-up position, raise one foot off the floor and bring your knee up 
towards your elbow.
* Pause then return to the starting position and repeat on the other side.
* Make sure to crunch your core at the top of the rep to bring your knee even 
closer to your elbow and get more out of your abs.

### Why?

If you want to sculpt a [Chris Hemsworth-style
physique](https://www.esquire.com/uk/life/fitness-wellbeing/g31985960/20-minute-bodyweight-workout-chris-hemsworth/)
then this primitive movement hammers your core while also targeting your legs,
arms, chest and shoulders (yup, all at once).

## 5. Standing Long Jump

![image](https://hips.hearstapps.com/ame-prod-menshealth-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/main/assets/standing-long-jump.gif?resize=480:*
"image")

### How to do the exercise

* Lower yourself into a squat position with your feet shoulder-width apart.
* Swing your arms back and use them to propel yourself forward.
* Bring your legs forward for additional momentum.
* Jump as far as you can and land on the soles of your feet.

### Why?

To build explosive strength, deploy the standing long jump, says Windebank. The
reason: this move targets your body’s all-important fast-twitch muscle fibres.

Unlike small slow-twitch fibres (the ones geared towards endurance) your
fast-twitch muscle fibres are used in fast power-packed movements.

## 6. Burpees

![image](https://hips.hearstapps.com/ame-prod-menshealth-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/main/assets/bastards.gif?resize=480:*
"image")

### How to do the exercise

* Start with your feet shoulder-width apart and squat down until your thighs 
  are parallel to the floor.
* From the bottom of the squat, place your hands on the floor and kick your 
  legs out behind you into a press-up position.
* Push up until your arms are straight and then tuck in your legs at the bottom 
  of the squat position.
* Drive upwards through your heels until you are six inches off the floor and 
  then repeat.

### Why?

By activating muscles almost everywhere on your body, the burpee will give you
a massive calorie burn due to the enormous effort required.

Not sure when to try this bodyweight goliath? “Try throwing them in between
strength sets or part of a basic bodyweight circuit,” says Windebank. Just know
that wherever you fit them in, they’re still not going to get any easier.

## 7. Handstand Wall Walk

![image](https://hips.hearstapps.com/ame-prod-menshealth-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/main/assets/handstand-wall-walk.gif?resize=480:*
"image")

### How to do the exercise

* Position yourself in a handstand position with your feet planted against a 
  wall.
* Move your hands forward and walk down the wall until you reach the bottom.

### Why?

Can you perform 40 press-ups without breaking? Then you’re ready for this
advanced muscle-builder, says Windebank: “The handstand walk will challenge
your entire posterior and anterior chain \[your back muscles\]. For me, that’s
why they’re one of the best bodyweight moves on the planet.”

But there’s one question you should ask before attempting this Insta-friendly
exercise: what’s the best way to do it without landing on your head? Answer:
“Squeeze your abs and glutes so you are maintaining a straight line during the
handstand,” says Windebank.

## 8. Wide-Grip Pull-Ups

![image](https://hips.hearstapps.com/ame-prod-menshealth-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/main/assets/wide-grip.gif?resize=480:*
"image")

### How to do the exercise

* Grab the bar with your palms facing away from you and your arms fully 
  extended.
* Your hands should be as wide as you can comfortably get them.
* Squeeze your shoulder blades together, exhale and drive your elbows towards 
  your hips to bring your chin above the bar.
* Lower under control back to the start position.

### Why?

Sure, normal pull-ups are great back-builders. So why not bring your shoulders
into the equation too? Wide-grip pulls-ups are the perfect lat attacker,
ramping up the effort needed for every rep compared to your normal pull-up.

And there’s a simple secret to getting the most from this move: form. Keep
tension in your glutes throughout the move to keep your body straight and
muscles injury-free, says Windebank.

## 9. Frozen V-Sit

![image](https://hips.hearstapps.com/ame-prod-menshealth-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/main/assets/frozen-v-sit.gif?resize=480:*
"image")

### How to do the exercise

* Lie down on your back with your arms and legs outstretched and your hands and 
  feet lifted just above the floor.
* Begin the exercise by simultaneously raising your torso and legs up to touch 
  your feet.
* Hold for five to 10 seconds.

### Why?

Searching for your six-pack? Take your time, says Windebank: “Abdominal
exercises should not be rushed; you need to perform them with control to
maximise the strength benefits.” And if you want to activate more of your
core’s muscle under even more tension then you should trade in crunches for
V-sits.

Make sure your shoulder blades don't roll forwards. This will keep your back
straight and help you get the most out of the exercise, advises Frost.

## 10. Single-Leg Glute Bridge

![image](https://hips.hearstapps.com/ame-prod-menshealth-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/main/assets/single-leg-glute-bridge.gif?resize=480:*
"image")

### How to do the exercise

* Lie on your back with one leg raised in the air.
* Thrust forward and raise your hips off the ground as high as you can.
* Slowly lower yourself to the floor.
* Clench your glutes at the top of the rep to activate more muscle fibres and 
  see greater growth.

### Why?

As well as shredding your legs, the single leg glute bridges will challenge
your entire posterior chain (your backside muscles). And why should a
butt-building muscle move make its way into your next workout? “Building
strength on your behind improves your posture, relieving any prolonged back
pain,” says Windebank. In other words, this is the cure for your new, temporary
desk set-up.

And if you’re aiming for a [larger
lower-body](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/workouts/g759260/step-up-leg-day-with-this-no-nonsense-functional-workout/)
then make sure to perform this exercise with complete control, squeezing your
working glute at the top of each repetition as hard as possible. “Once you’ve
managed that you can challenge yourself further by placing a barbell across
your hips,” says Windebank.
