# PART I: THE DISCIPLINE OF PERCEPTION 

## JANUARY: CLARITY 

## 19.08.25 January 1st CONTROL AND CHOICE

> “The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so
> that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control,
> and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I
> look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to
> the choices that are my own . . .” -- EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.5.4–5
                
Most important stoic practice is differentiating between what we can change and what we can’t.

Serenity Prayer: 
> “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage
> to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”
                
Addicts cannot undo the choices they have made, but they can change the future
                
If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our control
and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct
advantage over other people who **fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable
battle**.

### August 24th PILLAGE FROM ALL SOURCES 

> “I’ll never be ashamed to quote a bad writer with a good saying.” -- SENECA,
> ON TRANQUILITY OF MIND, 11.8 

Seneca. He was looking for wisdom, period. It didn’t matter where it came from. 

What matters is whether it makes your life better, whether it makes you better.

What wisdom or help would you be able to find today if you stopped caring about
affiliations and reputations? 

How much more could you see if you just focused on merit?

### August 25th RESPECT THE PAST, BUT BE OPEN TO THE FUTURE 

> Won’t you be walking in your predecessors’ footsteps? I surely will use the
> older path, but if I find a shorter and smoother way, I’ll blaze a trail
> there.  The ones who pioneered these paths aren’t our masters, but our
> guides. Truth stands open to everyone, it hasn’t been monopolized.” --
> SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 33.11
