# Writing is Thinking: Learning to Write with Confidence

_Edit: Thank you to the 60k people who have read this piece in its first week.
Writing continuously surprises me in just how far it can reach. Learning to
write in a way that will make people listen is a powerful skill that I hope all
people gain access to. Happy writing! - SS_

If you told me 5 years ago that I would one day lead a 20-person Publications
team or have a personal blog that’s read by hundreds of thousands, I would’ve
laughed in surprise. Yet somehow, I’ve found myself in that reality. _Here we
are_.

People often ask how I approach writing, so I decided to share this piece to
sway the self-conscious writer inside each one of us. I hope it encourages
others to develop a practice that enables them to write with confidence, by
simply sharing how I’ve designed my own.

## Practice Makes Possible

Growing up, English was my least favourite subject **by far**. In fact, I grew
up in Ontario, which mandated that only a single subject must be taken all the
way through secondary school. And of course, it was English. I remember
thinking﹣as any teenager would﹣that the world was a deeply unfair place. I
would happily pile on some additional Calculus or Chemistry, but the thought of
another year in English made me want to cry (and probably did at some point).

![English was by far the subject that zapped most of my mental
energy.](https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:no_upscale()/https%3A%2F%2Flh6.googleusercontent.com%2F35qK4fDetnTz6vSj7dqOQeFmsQhsy17GC7Jzv2KnlSIy9iNWbvck1MyPrv7MFEb_5PJbN-Fx3jGWM4Y4FikVTNxoVslzWEF4SRwab-f_W5-evDALhBjTqgAybTa8ucEJPy-Ac4XQ)

English was by far the subject that zapped most of my mental energy.

Anyone that struggles with writing (or any creative pursuit, really) knows that
when it doesn’t feel right, it’s not something that you can force. And if you
do, you end up with a blank slate covered in word vomit.

But what most people don’t realize is that the resistance to writing is not
unlike the resistance to other skills. And the antidote? Practice. Exposure.
Iteration.

Practice makes any seemingly impossible task _familiar_. You can learn to
write.

So since the days of braces and locker accessories, I’ve learned to write in a
way that isn’t so scary. And the more I write, the more I feel the [flywheel
effect](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html) in action. I
hope this article inspires the writer inside each person reading this, through
the understanding that writing is a skill that can be acquired through
continuous effort, easily accessed by creating a process with less friction.

## Writing is Thinking

The first step to becoming “a writer” is acknowledging that no metric defines
someone as “a writer”. And that anyone unabashedly claiming to be an expert, is
likely far from it. You know what makes you a writer? Writing.

> _"Each time you write a page, you are a writer. Each time you practice the
> violin, you are a musician. Each time you start a workout, you are an
> athlete. Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader." - [Atomic
> Habits](https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ)_

Writing, just like all else, is a muscle that can be flexed and built up into a
habitual process that eventually flows. Because at its core, writing is simple:
it’s a method of sharing your thoughts.

What most people don’t realize is that it’s often not actually the writing that
is difficult. It’s the _thinking_ behind the writing.

> _“Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so
> hard." - David McCullough_

Writing is essentially a robust tool that enables us to clarify and communicate
our thoughts. While writing, you are forcing yourself to think critically and
exercise parts of your brain that are typically on auto-pilot.  As Einstein
once said, _“If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well
enough.”_ In attempting to formulate a written piece, you are going through the
exercise of transforming vague ideas into clarified concepts externally, but
also internally.

But what is often overlooked is the fact that having a clarified, unique, and
thoughtful point of view greatly reduces the mental load required to write in
the first place. So which is the chicken and which is the egg?

![The Thinking and Writing
cycle](https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:no_upscale()/https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2F3MKVWAdc861cfRCMCL-RJTSSOsEOM1HBswnVwixczwmhe960zh4u8Rb0kISlqhHByThcO2R-Fs488ZDKcxbbhs3aiSmCmrqgdXX0uZpDZyd5HpTrfR0pFP9NVXjBDQe4Ehv_PDzz)

The Thinking and Writing cycle

Writing and thinking are two peas in a powerful pod. Critical thinking leads to
good writing, which leads to clearer thinking, and so on. By improving your
writing, you are also improving your ability to think and vice versa. So then
the question then becomes, how does one activate this process?

## Reducing Activation Energy

The thinking <> writing (TAW) cycle described above is powerful, but also
lofty. If I were to ask you to wake up tomorrow and have a finished article by
EOD, I’m diminishing the mental load of you taking on two tasks: (1) the
process of ideation and (2) the difficult task of abstracting these concepts
into something that does your ideas justice. Almost certainly, one would be
sacrificed across this short timeline. Most often, the focus on “producing an
article” results in a majority of energy going into the output (2), without
properly formulating the “why” behind an article (1), thereby making the
writing process more painful overall. It’s the TAW cycle with a whole lot of
friction, because you only have one turn around the wheel.

So my solution is simple: I separate the two and exercise the cycle many times
over.

It’s extremely rare that I’ll come up with a concept and knock out the piece in
one sitting. And I do this for a very specific reason: if I were to hold myself
to that standard, I would never even make it to the drawing board. I’ve
designed my writing process to embrace the practice of writing (and thinking),
with a focus on reducing the activation energy to show up in the first place.

## My Writing Process

Writing is by nature, a very personal and subjective process. So, if you take
anything away from this article, it is not the specific steps that I’ve
identified, but instead an ethos enabling you to craft your own.

To start, I would ask yourself the question, “What environment can I create
that will make it most likely for me to show up to this task?”

For me, that has come down to two things:

*   Decoupling
*   Optimizing for one variable

### Decoupling the Writing Process

As mentioned above, I intentionally separate out my process into multiple
steps: 6 to be exact (more on this below). I do this to utilize my [energy
levels](https://www.leadershipforces.com/plan-using-energy-levels/) optimally,
across **active** and **passive** states. I don’t always have the mental energy
to hard-core execute (active), so I allow myself to constantly and passively
conceptualize, without too much pressure. The process is designed such that
when I’m ready to enter an active state, like a focused writing session, I’ve
already established a clear line of thinking.

### Writing Process Steps:

*   Ideation - **Passive**
*   Tracking - **Active**
*   Outline - **Active**
*   Idea Arbitrage - **Passive**
*   Research - **Active**
*   Writing - **Active**

While this ping-pong between passive and active states may seem chaotic to
some, it is exactly what enables me to get things done without feeling
overwhelmed.

There’s a great tool called
[Draftback](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/draftback/nnajoiemfpldioamchanognpjmocgkbg),
which essentially lets you “go back in time to look over your own shoulder as
you write”.

✍ Been loving the Draftback Chrome extension to reflect on my writing process
by literally watching it.

2019](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1168978288968183808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

I use the tool to reflect on my process and understand how I iterate through an
article. Naturally, I’ve also used it to consider how I might improve my
process.

For example, this article (the one you’re reading), was created over a period
of over a month where I would go back and forth between thinking and writing,
until I finally had solidified what I was trying to say. It took over 19k
revisions.

The evolution of my Effective Leadership article.

I’m not necessarily encouraging others to iterate this many times, and if
anything I’m trying to scale back my edits, but it shows that the writing and
thinking process takes time to get right.

### Optimizing for One Variable

I’ve learned to accept that you can’t have everything in life. That sentiment
permeates into writing.

In my opinion, writing should never be something that you do just to check off
of your to-do list. At its core, writing is a mechanism to try to deliver value
to others. And over time, I’ve defined that as my core goal.

In order to achieve this, I have to come to terms with trading off other
variables like speed. As mentioned, many articles of my articles take weeks,
while others sometimes take months.

![The number of days it has taken me to write articles on my personal
blog.](https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:no_upscale()/https%3A%2F%2Fblog.stephsmith.io%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2F2019%2F10%2Fimage-3.png)

The number of days it has taken me to write articles on my personal blog.

This clearly isn’t always to my advantage, but it gives me something to orient
around. If I tried to optimize completely across quality, speed, SEO-potential,
among other variables, I would get paralyzed. So instead, I focus on one thing:
quality.

If you’re in a similar place of liberty to work on articles at your own pace,
you may also consider making quality your north star. The point here isn’t that
you need to choose the same north star, but to establish one that you form your
process around. On that note, let’s jump into my writing process.

## Step 1) Ideation: Passive

The first step in my process is intentionally **passive**. In order to get my
TAW loop going, I set an open invitation to my brain to take note of anything
interesting. More specifically, I look for anything within the intersection of:
(1) interesting, (2) doesn’t exist online in that exact form, and (3) something
I can contribute uniquely to.

![Idea Ikigai: the intersection of things that make a good
article.](https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:no_upscale()/https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2F69HNUU5KtotGTWL8-GC9YdLx729yqHaMmCqaUQnyed9mX6WAZgmILBLKVp-VPKSaBG0U0pWeOU8Jhf92cWJgG362MmKp7yCULHoNdJ27wJJXku3nLCKeAmTdm-3bJpwvr2eUslGO)

Idea Ikigai: the intersection of things that make a good article.

With the barrier to entry to launching a blog or publish an article these days
being so low, there is candidly a lot of crap out there. Before jotting down an
idea, I ask myself, _“Does this exist on the internet today?”_ and if not,
_“Should it?”_. If I can answer those questions with confidence, I’ll consider
pursuing the piece. For the same reason that I will never drop ship plastic
goods that no one needs, I will never publish an article that I don’t truly
believe can benefit others.

It’s not just about being considerate. It’s much harder to get attention on an
article that is the same as thousands of others on the Internet. It’s also hard
to write a good article about something you don’t care about (that’s why
writing was such a draining task in school). So you can do yourself, along with
the rest of the world, a favour by simply considering, _“What is something that
I can uniquely contribute?”_.

For example, I don’t need to tell the world that remote work is growing**﹣**we
have enough people doing that. But perhaps it would be helpful for me to talk
about how someone with a [non-technical background might find a remote
role](https://blog.stephsmith.io/non-technical-remote-jobs/). I’ve been through
multiple of these roles myself, hired a couple dozen non-technical remote
teammates, and have spent years thinking about the topic.

Anything that checks the right boxes will get the TAW cycle started, but I
still won’t try to force it. In a few cases, I’ll sit down and write up a full
draft. But for most, this step is simply adding the concept in a new Google
doc.

What actually goes into the document varies significantly. Sometimes, it’s as
little as a single line or link. Below are two examples, where you can see that
article concepts often start out super basic and often unclear.

Basic outline for a future article about positivity being a choice.

These ideas for these articles come from absolutely everywhere. Conversations,
[books](https://stephsmith.io/books) and articles, personal experiences, and
random [Google
searches](https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1164942345902665729) have all
generated inspiration for pieces.

You know when you’re younger and someone disagrees with you, so they ask you to
rattle off examples supporting your argument? Put on the spot, you feel stuck
and unable to think of any, despite knowing there are many. The same would be
true if I asked you to come up with 10 great article topics on the spot.
Allowing yourself to catch onto signals passively is the most sure route to
accumulating a lovely cabinet of concepts.

For example, the impetus behind some of my articles came from the following:

## Step 2) Tracking: Active

The next step is tracking, which is basically just adding the idea to my
ongoing spreadsheet. But more importantly, I’ll typically take the opportunity
to quickly do some keyword research. This is for two reasons:

1. I want to see if the article has the potential to rank. Even though SEO is a
   fancy word for a not-so-fancy industry, keyword research is essentially a
   mechanism to see if this is something people are actually looking for. If
   there is no search volume, yet I still think it can deliver value, I’ll
   write it anyway. But I want to be cognizant of this: Google processes
   billions of queries and if there is literally no search volume, I need to be
   able to justify why this might be.
2. I also do keyword research at this stage to spot secondary keywords that may
   influence the outline I create next. I make sure to do it at this stage,
   because I’m not a fan of keyword stuffing, but I do believe in Google is a
   big data mine to understand what people want to know. If I incorporate those
   signals into the outline, I’m not only more likely to bring in more traffic,
   but genuinely deliver a better article serving people’s needs.

I could and probably will write an entire article (or 10) on how I approach SEO
research, but for the purpose of this article, I’ll just share that I use these
tools: [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/), [Keyword
Planner](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/), and [Keywords
Everywhere](https://keywordseverywhere.com/).

![My ongoing document tracking current, future, and past
articles.](https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:no_upscale()/https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2F-937inVVaVP2HUq79c7yQHAEYqqKti_loIbGxZsz7NgFQvtgTEuDCpwfwxkIQHfPkBPKcNDk1PB50hibURbJ9c-VaWiBMfwig97ZH2SlkJCDY1nP2pQtJWqFSWreADCpm6yPvleY)

My ongoing document tracking current, future, and past articles.

## Step 3) Outline - Active

At this point, I’ll utilize the mix of my (rough) ideas and SEO research to
create an outline. It’s always in bullet-point form and will have approximately
3-6 major headings, with sub-points underneath.

It’s important to start the outline at this stage, as this will set the stage
for the next step of passive “idea arbitrage”.

![My original outline for my recent article, Gaining Perspective Through
Untranslatable
Words](https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:no_upscale()/https%3A%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2FsZqFK0Fsa7-XpnAljtDu7zY2DbfTJTn4DT1OkSYR5wGGhRlz9CAESVoqa1fxCHqLfZ6sUqKFmGtuxDzvNaZt7eRctoN3gJ94ysPzYPtaEZtOz580Tdlk7s3R7jUb9fhm6CQS8j3S)

My original outline for my recent article, Gaining Perspective Through
Untranslatable Words

## Step 4) Idea Arbitrage - Passive

After creating an outline, I enter the fourth stage: Idea Arbitrage﹣my
personal favourite. Despite the ridiculous name I’ve chosen for this stage, I
ultimately feel as though this is the part of my process which makes my
articles stand out.

In this stage, I simply let the article sit. I let the creative juices in my
passive brain marinate and be stimulated by just about anything.

If I run into an interesting tweet or quote or tidbit from an article, I’ll
make sure to add it to the right outline. I do this for literally weeks or even
months, until I feel like I’ve crafted a unique point of view.

To augment this process, I love using two tools:
[Readwise](https://readwise.io/) and [Weava
highlighter](https://www.weavatools.com/).

* [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) syncs all of my Kindle quotes (now over 1000
  highlights across 20+ [books](https://stephsmith.io/books)). Prior to
  Readwise, I literally would take time and type these into a Google sheet.
  But now, it’s a seamless “Sync highlights” click and a delightful UI to sift
  through them. I’ll typically go through new quotes monthly and add them to
  the respective outlines that are in the passive idea arbitrage stage.
* Similarly, when I am reading an online article and a particular quote sticks
  out to me, I’ll utilize the [Weava highlighter](https://www.weavatools.com/)
  to store the thought and return to them periodically. In addition to
  augmenting my writing process, this practice helps with reading retention.

![Example of the Weava
interface.](https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:no_upscale()/https%3A%2F%2Flh4.googleusercontent.com%2F9a2uWiT9aR8F1i9qgWoACkNDiCtXoipOD7ah9V4dPkJUEeoz-QdFMVe-hxQHUKwQApwOsJRlpHtUsxhRSvXblvzGkZ4zWaLMa3-aM1zBDXyw-f3y4j5yZ6l-SLQCzHAZwARsebMx)

Example of the Weava interface.
  
An important note: when I first started doing this, I would just blindly toss
ideas into Evernote, but that required a whole lot of cleanup when I started
writing the piece. With the new process of setting up the outline from the
outset, I’m instead actively filing this information where needed. It’s my own
personal Dewey Decimal system, so that when it comes down to writing a piece, I
have a beautiful library to operate off of.

![Visual of the idea arbitrage
step.](https://pocket-image-cache.com//filters:no_upscale()/https%3A%2F%2Flh4.googleusercontent.com%2FYqtv2PRRAJrEj5KsK45F0Cfw2yJfXMDtBcShRssht-8eex2m-FZqJEgJMwsVuchLR4yjsEfQ2JUZXjpfTdcGcObOVz4AT7R6F7R4aarGUIxuhYtze3ejtLgzVNDQqd4Othkk50-V)

Visual of the idea arbitrage step.

## Step 5) Research - Active

Often, a piece needs more than a few tweets or quotes to truly have authority.
So, I typically augment an article with at least a few hours of active
research. This stage closely mimics the research that one would do to write a
college essay, but this **only** happens once I’ve done quite a bit of passive
ruminating, so that I have a clear POV of what I want to convey. I thoroughly
enjoy this phase, as it allows me to “write to learn”; to build my articles off
of not just my intuition, but the amazing work of others.

> _“To write a great book, you must first become the book.”  -_ [_Atomic
> Habits_](https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ)

## Step 6) Writing - Active

Finally, it’s time for the hard part: writing.

I’ll typically only sit down to really craft a piece once I have at least a few
thousand words of what I’ve started to call “notes ‘n quotes”. The reason I do
this is simple: I am not a natural writer. Putting words down on paper
sometimes comes naturally to me, but often it does not. And that means that in
order for me to consistently write, I need to make it as easy as possible for
me to build the habit; I need to lower the activation energy to start.

> lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control.” -_
> [_Atomic Habits_](https://amzn.to/31t6vQZ)

If I’m sitting down to a blank slate of pixels, you better bet my brain sets
off an alarm that “This will be hard and grueling and you can’t do this,
Steph!”. But if instead, I’m sitting down to an outline that I’ve been
passively ruminating on, that’s supported by concrete examples, it doesn’t seem
so bad. I’m effectively approaching the writing phase, with maybe 7/10 of the
work already completed.

Had I decided to write an article from scratch in a day, not only would the end
result be more shallow, it would freak me the f\*\*\* out. And quite frankly, I
just wouldn’t do it. In effect, I’m trying to be patient with my own psyche and
set up an environment that makes me most likely to get started.

> secret is this: It's not the writing part that's hard. What's hard is sitting
> down to write.” - [The War of Art](https://amzn.to/2O1NtNe)_

When I am struggling to put words on paper, I’ll ask myself the following
questions:

* ___How would I explain this to a friend?___ This helps me discern whether
  I’ve actually spent enough time thinking through the core concepts.
  Remember, writing is thinking.
*  ___What specifically are you getting hung up on?___ I find that sometimes I
   can get caught up in certain problematic routines. For example, if I created
   an outline with a ton of info, sometimes I struggle to strip some of it out.
   If I reflect and catch myself doing this, I will more readily cut things
   out.

This is the only phase where I will set time limits. Not because I have
deadlines, but because I’m trying to improve my “finishing muscle”. To this
day, I still have over a dozen articles that I almost finished, but did not.
And there’s a clear course across all of them. I got maybe 80-90% there, but
since I didn’t finish them completely, the [Lindy
effect](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1158964119023652864) only becomes more
material.

So while not always possible, once I start the active writing process (Step 6),
I try to close out the article in that particular session, get my little hit of
dopamine, and then move on.

## Personal Disclaimer

It’s important to note that this is **my personal style** of researching and
writing, built upon the constraints (or lack thereof) within my life; most
markedly that this is a personal blog. I don’t have deadlines or an editor to
impress. Instead, my north star is delivering articles I’m proud of. In all
honesty, this process almost certainly would not work in a paid writing
environment solely due to turnaround expectations, but as an independent
writer, I love the flexibility it gives me to create content that I'm happy to
put my name on.

It’s also worth noting that because I’ve been doing this for a while, I have
over 50 pending articles at some stage in the process. I estimate that for
every article I publish, a few new article ideas spring to mind, so I’m never
really jaded or in search of something to write. I view this entire process as
a way to formulate, process, and share my ideas, but I’ve found that a
byproduct has been that it helps me think more clearly. As I go through the
weeks or months of dwelling on the core takeaways of a given article, I learn
to transform what are sometimes vague and lacking concepts into tactile,
digestible pieces.

As such, I’ve started to use the very process for a book that I hope to write:
Thinking in Curves. _It’s currently in the Idea Arbitrage state (and been there
for months)._ :)

## Just Do It

In hopes that you will go out there and write, I encourage you to focus on the
process and not the outcome. Many of your articles, as many of mine are, will
be flops. Even some of your best may never get noticed.

The best way to improve your writing skills is to write (and to write a lot).
If you’re focused on a process that helps you build new skills, most notably
your ability to parse and process information tactfully, you cannot lose.

With any skill that you hope to acquire, there is no magic moment. It’s a
never-ending process of going from [good to
great](https://blog.stephsmith.io/how-to-be-great/). And certainly with
writing, a post will never write itself, so it’s up to you to keep yourself
accountable.

At the end of the day, there are few things more rewarding than looking back at
a collection of work that you’ve delivered to the world that is indeed all your
own. So get out there, design a process that works for you, and push forward
with no intention of an expiry date.
