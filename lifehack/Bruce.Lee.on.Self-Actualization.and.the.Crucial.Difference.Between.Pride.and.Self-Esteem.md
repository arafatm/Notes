# Bruce Lee on Self-Actualization and the Crucial Difference Between Pride and Self-Esteem

_“Real self-esteem is an integration of an inner value with things in the world
around you,”_ Anna Deavere Smith wrote in her [invaluable advice to young
artists](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/05/01/letters-to-a-young-artist-anna-deavere-smith-confidence/).
But how does one master the intricacies of that integration?

That’s what legendary Chinese-American martial artist, philosopher, and
filmmaker **Bruce Lee** (November 27, 1940–July 20, 1973) explores in one of
the pieces collected in [**_Bruce Lee: Artist of
Life_**](http://www.amazon.com/Artist-Life-Bruce-Lee-Library/dp/0804832633/?tag=braipick-20)
([_public
library_](http://www.worldcat.org/title/bruce-lee-artist-of-life/oclc/41531810&referer=brief_results))
— the invaluable compendium of his never-before-published private letters,
notes, essays, and poems that also gave us [the origin of his famous metaphor
for
resilience](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/05/29/like-water-bruce-lee-artist-of-life/).

In an essay titled “The Passionate State of Mind,” Lee writes:

> We can see through others only when we see through ourselves.

> Lack of self-awareness renders us transparent; a soul that knows itself is
> opaque.

> \[…\]

> To become different from what we are, we must have some awareness of what we
> are… Yet it is remarkable that the very people who are most self-dissatisfied
> and crave most for a new identity have the least self-awareness. They have
> turned away from an unwanted self and hence never had a good look at it. The
> result is that those most dissatisfied can neither dissimulate nor attain a
> real change of heart. They are transparent, and their unwanted qualities
> persist through all attempts at self-dramatization and self-transformation.

Our lack of self-awareness, Lee argues, makes us look to others to tell us who
we are. (Learning not to do that is one of [life’s hardest, most important
lessons](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/23/nine-years-of-brain-pickings/).)
He considers the perilous yet profoundly human [impulse for
conformity](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/09/30/how-to-be-a-nonconformist-elissa-jane-karg/):

> We have more faith in what we imitate than in what we originate. We cannot
> derive a sense of absolute certitude from anything that has its roots in us.
> The most poignant sense of insecurity comes from standing alone; we are not
> alone when we imitate. It is thus with most of us! We are what other people
> say we are. We know ourselves chiefly by hearsay.

Echoing Anaïs Nin’s [memorable meditation on character and personal
responsibility](https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/10/25/anais-nin-on-parenting-character-and-personal-responsibility/),
Lee points out that this tendency is what dogma preys on:

> There is a powerful craving in most of us to see ourselves as instruments in
> the hands of others and thus free ourselves from the responsibility for acts
> that are prompted by our own questionable inclinations and impulses. Both the
> strong and the weak grasp at the alibi. The latter hide their malevolence
> under the virtue of obedience; they acted dishonorably because they had to
> obey orders. The strong, too, claim absolution by proclaiming themselves the
> chosen instrument of a higher power — God, history, fate, nation, or
> humanity.

At the root at our misguided grasping at self-worth, Lee asserts, is a
confusion between pride and self-esteem. He examines the crucial difference
between the two:

> Pride is a sense of worth derived from something that is not part of us,
> while self-esteem derives from the potentialities and achievements of self.
> We are proud when we identify ourselves with an imaginary self, a leader, a
> holy cause, a collective body of possessions. There is fear and intolerance
> in pride; it is insensitive and uncompromising. The less promise and potency
> in the self, the more imperative is the need for pride. The core of pride is
> self-rejection.

We acquire a true sense of self-worth, Lee notes, by examining ourselves in
order to identify our talents — Epictetus’s notion of [self-scrutiny applied
with
kindness](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/10/10/the-art-of-living-sharon-lebell/)
comes to mind — and then working hard to realize them. This purposeful drive
for self-actualization, nowhere more beautifully articulated than in [Thomas
Wolfe’s letters to his
mother](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/12/01/thomas-wolfe-letters-to-his-mother-ambition/),
is the true wellspring of self-esteem. Lee writes:

> Action is a high road to self-confidence and \[self-\]esteem. Where it is
> open, all energies flow toward it. It comes readily to most people and its
> rewards are tangible.

And yet self-esteem isn’t a static object to be attained but a dynamic sense to
be continually cultivated:

> The maintenance of self-esteem is a continuous task that taxes all of the
> individual’s power and inner resources. We have to prove our worth and
> justify our existence anew each day.

In a sentiment all the more poignant amid our age of rampant shootings and mass
malevolence, Lee considers how seductive the illusory substitutes for
self-esteem become in its absence:

> When, for whatever reason, self-esteem is unattainable, the autonomous
> individual becomes a highly explosive entity. He turns away from an
> unpromising self and plunges into the pursuit of pride — the explosive
> substitute for self-esteem. All social disturbances and upheavals have their
> roots in a crisis of individual self-esteem, and the great endeavors in which
> the masses most readily unite \[are\] basically a search for pride.

then revisit Anne Lamott on [how to stop keeping ourselves small by
people-pleasing](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/05/16/anne-lamott-people-pleasing-haters-trolls/)
