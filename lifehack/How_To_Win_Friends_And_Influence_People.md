http://bookoutlines.pbworks.com/w/page/14422673/How%20To%20Win%20Friends%20and%20Influence%20People

## Part One

### Fundamental Techniques in Handling People

- **Don’t criticize**, condemn, or complain. (It rarely helps the situation)
- Give **honest sincere appreciation**.
- Arouse in the other person an **eager want**.

## Part Two

### Six Ways To Make People Like You

- Become **genuinely interested** in other people.
- **Smile**.
- Remember that a **person’s name** is to that person the sweetest and most 
  important sound in any language.
- Be a good listener. Encourage others to **talk about themselves**. (This is 
  the secret to being a great conversationalist.)
- Talk in terms of the **other person’s interests**.
- Make the **other person feel important** and do it sincerely.

## Part Three

### Win People To Your Way Of Thinking

- The only way to get the best of **an argument is to avoid it**. (Because even 
  if you win, you aren’t going to get what you want.)
- Show **respect for the other person’s opinions**. Never say, “You’re wrong.”
- **If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically**. (A good way to start 
  is to admit that you could be mistaken.)
- Begin in a **friendly way**.
- Get the **other person saying “yes, yes**” immediately.
- Let the **other person do a great deal of the talking**.
- Let the **other person feel that the idea is his or hers**.
- Try honestly to see things from the **other person’s point of view**.
- Be sympathetic with the other **person’s ideas and desires**.
- Appeal to the **nobler motives**. (Even if deep down they make the decision 
  based on the baser ones. **Everyone wants to be the hero of their own 
  story**.)
- **Dramatize your ideas**. (A picture and a story are worth a thousand words.)
- Throw down a **challenge**. (Do this **when all else fails**.) 

## Part Four

### Be A Leader: How To Change People Without Giving Offense Or Arousing Resentment

- **Begin with praise** and honest appreciation.
- Call attention to **people’s mistakes indirectly**.
- Talk about your **own mistakes** before criticizing the other person.
- **Ask questions** instead of giving direct orders.
- Let the **other person save face**.
- **Praise the slightest improvement** and praise every improvement. Be "hearty 
  in your approbation and lavish in your praise."
- Give the other person a **fine reputation** to live up to.
- Use **encouragement**. Make the fault seem easy to correct.
- Make the other person **happy about doing the thing you suggest**.

## End notes:

**The ability to speak is a shortcut to distinction**. It puts a person in the 
limelight, raises one head and shoulders above the crowd. And the person who 
can speak acceptably is usually given credit for an ability out of all 
proportion to what he or she really possesses.

## An alternate summary from Farnham Street:

### Criticism

- **Criticism is futile** because it puts a person on the defensive and usually 
  makes him strive to justify himself.
- **Criticism is dangerous**, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, 
  hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.
- **Any fool can criticize**, condemn and complain—and most fools do. But it 
  takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.

"A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men." -- Thomas 
Carlyle

### Dealing with people

When dealing with people, let us remember **we are not dealing with creatures 
of logic**. We are dealing with creatures of **emotion**, creatures bristling 
with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.

### Influence

The only way on earth to influence other people is to **talk about what they 
want and show them how to get it**.

### The secret of success

If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the **ability to get the 
other person’s point of view** and see things from that person’s angle as well 
as from your own.
