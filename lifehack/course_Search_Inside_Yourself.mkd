## Day 1 Homework

The first video we saw today by Dan Harris, author of “10% Happier,” which
talks about how he came to discover the benefits of mindfulness.  
[Dan Harris: Hack Your Brain’s Default Node with Meditation](https://youtu.be/FAcTIrA2Qhk)

The second video below features Daniel Goleman, author of “Emotional
Intelligence,” which covers some information about how the emotional center of
our brains plays a part in decision making. We will be discussing this video
during tomorrow's session . 
[Dan Goleman: Neuroscience of Emotions and Decision Making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQX-w87J3Vw)

The third video is by Jon Kabat Zinn on how Mindfulness helps us to relate to
our thoughts.  We will be discussing this video during tomorrow's session as
well.  
[Jon Kabat Zinn:  Mindfulness Dissolves Thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvLRheIPY90)

Here are the recommended practices we talked about at the end of today’s program. 

Try out one dedicated practice and one integrated practice today and we’ll talk
about what that was like for you tomorrow morning!

1. Sitting Practice 1-minute (aka "Dedicated Practice):

Focused Attention Practice:  Practice 1-minute of focused attention practice.
Start by finding a quiet place to sit.  With your eyes closed or slightly open,
taking one minute to simply focus on your breath.  You can do this by paying
attention to the feeling of air as it passes through your nostrils, or also by
paying attention to the rise and fall of your abdomen as you breathe.  You can
breathe normally for this practice.  Just sit and observe.

2. Integrated Practice: Mindful Listening -or- 3 Mindful Bites

Mindful Listening Practice: Use mindful listening in a conversation that you
have today either with a coworker, friend, or family member.  To practice, you
can either let the other person know that you are going to practice mindful
listening, or you can do it in “stealth” mode by simply putting your full
attention on the other person when they are talking, and perhaps taking a
moment to consider your response before immediately responding.

OR ...

Begin one meal with 3 mindful bites: At a meal today, try starting by taking 3
mindful bites. Pay attention to how you pick up the food, to your first bite,
to the flavors and how the food feels in your mouth as you chew and swallow.
How does it change your experience of the food? 

## Day 2 Self Awareness

Self Awareness => Emotional Awareness

Img: Emotions in the Body
- heatmap of body under different emotions

Decisions are made in both:

Existential (I Am) vs Experiential (I Am Experiencing)

Exercise: Bodyscan

Micropractice: Head, body, Heart Check-in
- Head: thoughts
- Body: emotions, intuition 
- Heart: values, intentions

Exercise: Journaling

## Day 2 Homework

1. Watch Video ["Just Breathe"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVA2N6tX2cg)

- Body Scan Meditation:  Try this [3-minute guided Body Scan
  meditation.](https://soundcloud.com/searchinsideyourself/w2-d11_body-scan/s-PpJHK)

Head, Gut, Heart practice: Take a few moments to do the 3 Centers Practice.
Starting with one breath checking in with what you’re noticing in your Head,
followed by a breath checking in with what you’re noticing in your gut, and
finally the last breath checking in with your heart.

3. Self-Awareness Journaling:  Pick at least 2 journaling prompts from below.
   Write for 3 minutes for each question.  Try using an open writing style,
   meaning just keep writing, even if you don’t know what to say.  Try not to
   edit yourself while writing.  Simply start a timer and write for 3 minutes.  

After you’ve completed your journaling, take a moment to reread what you wrote.
What do you notice?  Are there any similarities or contradictions?  What
insights have you gained in reflecting on these topics?

- In this moment, I am aware that … 
- I feel happiest when …
- If I knew I could not fail I would …
- What matters most to me in my life right now is ...

And, of course, you are welcome to continue practicing Mindful Listening,
Mindful Bites, and an attention training practice!

   Notice, Reflect, & Respond).  Then, afterward, take a few moments to reflect
   on how that went for you.  Did it help you to engage with the situation in a

[Difficult Conversations](https://www.blinkist.com/en/nc/reader/difficult-conversations-en/): 3 Levels 
- Content
- Feelings
- Identity

When having a difficult conversation, think of the other person's perspective.
Especially Feelings and Identity. Content doesn't differ much.

Practice: Think of a difficult converstation you had
- Verbalize each of your "3 levels" from YOUR point of view
- Content (what happened?)
- Feelings (How did I feel?)
- Identity (What's at stake?)
  - Am I competent?
  - Am I a good person?
  - Am I worthy of love and respect?

Sometimes it's helpful to start from the 3rd story (Identity)

Remember: Impact != Intention

Practice: 
- What stands out to you in this course? 
- What are you committed to practicing?

- SBNRR "What I heard you say is..."
- daily meditation
- weekly journaling?
