## JANUARY CLARITY

### January 1st CONTROL AND CHOICE

“The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so
that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and
which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for
good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the
choices that are my own . . .” —EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.5.4–5

differentiating between what we can change and what we can’t.

Serenity Prayer: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot
change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the
difference.”

cannot undo the choices they have made

can change the future—through

If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our control
and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct
advantage over other people who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable
battle.

### January 2nd EDUCATION IS FREEDOM

“What is the fruit of these teachings? Only the most beautiful and proper
harvest of the truly educated—tranquility, fearlessness, and freedom. We should
not trust the masses who say only the free can be educated, but rather the
lovers of wisdom who say that only the educated are free.” —EPICTETUS,
DISCOURSES, 2.1.21–23a

Remember that imperative on the days you start to feel distracted, when
watching television or having a snack seems like a better use of your time than
reading or studying philosophy. Knowledge—self-knowledge in particular—is
freedom.

### January 3rd BE RUTHLESS TO THE THINGS THAT DON’T MATTER

“How many have laid waste to your life when you weren’t aware of what you were
losing, how much was wasted in pointless grief, foolish joy, greedy desire, and
social amusements—how little of your own was left to you. You will realize you
are dying before your time!” —SENECA, ON THE BREVITY OF LIFE, 3.3b

One of the hardest things to do in life is to say “No.” To invitations, to
requests, to obligations, to the stuff that everyone else is doing.

Even harder is saying no to certain time-consuming emotions: anger, excitement,
distraction, obsession, lust.

the more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes
to the things that do.

### January 4th THE BIG THREE

“All you need are these: certainty of judgment in the present moment; action
for the common good in the present moment; and an attitude of gratitude in the
present moment for anything that comes your way.” —MARCUS AURELIUS,
MEDITATIONS, 9.6

an attitude of gratitude in the present moment for anything that comes your
way.” —MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 9.6

**Perception, Action, Will.**

- Control your perceptions
- Direct your actions properly
- Willingly accept what's outside your control.

### January 5th CLARIFY YOUR INTENTIONS

“Let all your efforts be directed to something, let it keep that end in view.
It’s not activity that disturbs people, but false conceptions of things that
drive them mad.” —SENECA, ON TRANQUILITY OF MIND, 12.5

It’s not activity that disturbs people, but false conceptions

Plan All The Way To The End.

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is: begin with an end in mind.

Having an end in mind is no guarantee that you’ll reach it but not having an
end in mind is a guarantee you won’t.

### January 6th WHERE, WHO, WHAT, AND WHY

“A person who doesn’t know what the universe is, doesn’t know where they are. A
person who doesn’t know their purpose in life doesn’t know who they are or what
the universe is. A person who doesn’t know any one of these things doesn’t know
why they are here. So what to make of people who seek or avoid the praise of
those who have no knowledge of where or who they are?” —MARCUS AURELIUS,
MEDITATIONS, 8.52

Have you taken the time to get clarity about who you are and what you stand
for?

### January 7th SEVEN CLEAR FUNCTIONS OF THE MIND

“The proper work of the mind is the exercise of choice, refusal, yearning,
repulsion, preparation, purpose, and assent. What then can pollute and clog the
mind’s proper functioning? Nothing but its own corrupt decisions.” —EPICTETUS,
DISCOURSES, 4.11.6–7

**Choice** to do and think right

**Refusal** of temptation

**Yearning** to be better

**Repulsion** of negativity, of bad influences, of what isn’t true

**Preparation** for what lies ahead or whatever may happen

**Purpose** our guiding principle and highest priority

**Assent** to be free of deception about what’s inside and outside our control

### January 8th SEEING OUR ADDICTIONS

“We must give up many things to which we are addicted, considering them to be
good. Otherwise, courage will vanish, which should continually test itself.
Greatness of soul will be lost, which can’t stand out unless it disdains as
petty what the mob regards as most desirable. —SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 74.12b–13

harmless indulgences can easily become full-blown addictions. e.g.
- coffee in the morning,
- email because it’s part of our job,

we’ve "lost the freedom to abstain."

### January 9th WHAT WE CONTROL AND WHAT WE DON’T

“Some things are in our control, while others are not. We control our opinion,
choice, desire, aversion, and, in a word, everything of our own doing. We don’t
control our body, property, reputation, position, and, in a word, everything
not of our own doing. Even more, the things in our control are by nature free,
unhindered, and unobstructed, while those not in our control are weak, slavish,
can be hindered, and are not our own.” —EPICTETUS, ENCHIRIDION, 1.1–2

you won't control the external events

can control our opinion about those events.

You don’t control the situation, but you control what you think about it.

an honest understanding of what is within our control provides real clarity
about the world:

### January 10th IF YOU WANT TO BE STEADY

“The essence of good is a certain kind of reasoned choice; just as the essence
of evil is another kind. What about externals, then? They are only the raw
material for our reasoned choice, which finds its own good or evil in working
with them. How will it find the good? Not by marveling at the material! For if
judgments about the material are straight that makes our choices good, but if
those judgments are twisted, our choices turn bad.” —EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES,
1.29.1–3

The Stoics seek steadiness, stability, and tranquility—traits

How does one embody eustatheia

it’s about filtering the outside world through the straightener of our
judgment.

If you want to be steady, if you want clarity, proper judgment is the best way.

### January 11th IF YOU WANT TO BE UNSTEADY

“For if a person shifts their caution to their own reasoned choices and the
acts of those choices, they will at the same time gain the will to avoid, but
if they shift their caution away from their own reasoned choices to things not
under their control, seeking to avoid what is controlled by others, they will
then be agitated, fearful, and unstable.” —EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.1.12

Epictetus is reminding you that serenity and stability are results of your
choices and judgment, not your environment.

If you seek to avoid all disruptions to tranquility—other people, external
events, stress—you will never be successful.

if you seek to avoid the harmful and disruptive judgments that cause those
problems, then you will be stable and steady wherever you happen to be.

### January 12th THE ONE PATH TO SERENITY

“Keep this thought at the ready at daybreak, and through the day and
night—there is only one path to happiness, and that is in giving up all outside
of your sphere of choice, regarding nothing else as your possession,
surrendering all else to God and Fortune.” —EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 4.4.39

remind yourself of what is in your control and what’s not in your control.

Remind yourself to focus on the former and not the latter.

As you lie in bed, remember that sleep is a form of surrender and trust and how
easily it comes. And prepare to start the whole cycle over again tomorrow.

### January 13th CIRCLE OF CONTROL

“We control our reasoned choice and all acts that depend on that moral will.
What’s not under our control are the body and any of its parts, our
possessions, parents, siblings, children, or country—anything with which we
might associate.” —EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 1.22.10

wise person knows what’s inside their circle of control and what is outside

According to the Stoics, the circle of control contains just one thing: YOUR
MIND.

You’ve got just one thing to manage: your choices, your will, your mind. So
mind it.

### January 14th CUT THE STRINGS THAT PULL YOUR MIND

“Understand at last that you have something in you more powerful and divine
than what causes the bodily passions and pulls you like a mere puppet. What
thoughts now occupy my mind? Is it not fear, suspicion, desire, or something
like that?” —MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 12.19

Philosophy is simply asking us to pay careful attention and to strive to be
more than a pawn.

paying attention requires work and awareness, but isn’t that better than being
jerked about on a string?

### January 15th PEACE IS IN STAYING THE COURSE

“Tranquility can’t be grasped except by those who have reached an unwavering
and firm power of judgment—the rest constantly fall and rise in their
decisions, wavering in a state of alternately rejecting and accepting things.
What is the cause of this back and forth? It’s because nothing is clear and
they rely on the most uncertain guide—common opinion.” —SENECA, MORAL LETTERS,
95.57b–58a

**euthymia**, which he defines as “believing in yourself and trusting that you
are on the right path, and not being in doubt by following the myriad footpaths
of those wandering in every direction.”

tranquility and peace are found in identifying our path and in sticking to it:
staying the course—making adjustments here and there, naturally—but ignoring
the distracting sirens

### January 16th NEVER DO ANYTHING OUT OF HABIT

“So in the majority of other things, we address circumstances not in accordance
with the right assumptions, but mostly by following wretched habit. Since all
that I’ve said is the case, the person in training must seek to rise above, so
as to stop seeking out pleasure and steering away from pain; to stop clinging
to living and abhorring death; and in the case of property and money, to stop
valuing receiving over giving.” —MUSONIUS RUFUS, LECTURES, 6.25.5–11

Find what you do out of rote memory or routine. Ask yourself: Is this really
the best way to do it? Know why you do what you do—do it for the right reasons.

### January 17th REBOOT THE REAL WORK

“I am your teacher and you are learning in my school. My aim is to bring you to
completion, unhindered, free from compulsive behavior, unrestrained, without
shame, free, flourishing, and happy, looking to God in things great and
small—your aim is to learn and diligently practice all these things. Why then
don’t you complete the work, if you have the right aim and I have both the
right aim and right preparation? What is missing? . . . The work is quite
feasible, and is the only thing in our power. . . . Let go of the past. We must
only begin. Believe me and you will see.” —EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.19.29–34

**just begin** the work. The rest follows.

### January 18th SEE THE WORLD LIKE A POET AND AN ARTIST

“Pass through this brief patch of time in harmony with nature, and come to your
final resting place gracefully, just as a ripened olive might drop, praising
the earth that nourished it and grateful to the tree that gave it growth.”
—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 4.48.2

There is clarity (and joy) in seeing what others can’t see, in finding grace
and harmony in places others overlook. Isn’t that far better than seeing the
world as some dark place?

### January 19th WHEREVER YOU GO, THERE YOUR CHOICE IS

“A podium and a prison is each a place, one high and the other low, but in
either place your freedom of choice can be maintained if you so wish.”
—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.6.25

But in all circumstances—adversity

One thing will stay constant: our freedom of choice—both in the big picture and small picture.

### January 20th REIGNITE YOUR THOUGHTS

“Your principles can’t be extinguished unless you snuff out the thoughts that
feed them, for it’s continually in your power to reignite new ones. . . . It’s
possible to start living again! See things anew as you once did—that is how to
restart life!” —MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 7.2

no matter what happens, no matter how disappointing our behavior has been in
the past, the principles themselves remain unchanged. We can return and embrace
them at any moment. What happened yesterday—what happened five minutes ago—is
the past. We can reignite and restart whenever we like.
