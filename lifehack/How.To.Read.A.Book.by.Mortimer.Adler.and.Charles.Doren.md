## What’s in it for me? Become a reading machine.

Did you struggle to read the assigned texts at school? Probably. We might love
to read for pleasure, but when it comes to working on books and articles that
don’t interest us, we have to fight hard to keep engaged.

It doesn’t have to be this way. There is a method for reading even the driest
of books quickly and efficiently. A cult hit in the 1940s, How to Read a Book
can help you get more from your reading, whether you need to bone up quickly on
that novel for English class, or learn about that new marketing text for work.

In these blinks, you’ll find out
- why you can’t be a passive reader;
- why the Table of Contents is your friend; and
- why even the brightest of people might need to keep a dictionary handy.

## In order to get more from books, you need to read actively and learn some basic reading rules.

Do you take any moment you can to get lost in a good novel? When we’re reading
for the sheer joy of it, there’s no real need to change our approach to it.
There are occasions, though, when we don’t read just for our own entertainment
and we need to understand and select information from a text quickly. Before we
look at some tips and tricks on how to do this best, let’s first see what it
means to be an effective reader.

First, the basics.

The first thing you should know is that reading is an active task, not a
passive one. You can see it like a ball game where one party throws the ball
and the other party has to make an effort in order to catch it. That is, the
“catcher” – or reader – has to make an effort in order to understand what the
author, who throws the ball, is trying to convey.

This means that you can’t be lazy and expect all the relevant information to
immediately flow to you. Getting what you want from a book requires work and,
just as with any other activity, if you want to become a highly proficient
reader, you must learn and practice the skills involved.

In the ball game example, you become a skilled catcher if you know the rules of
the game, and if you commit to practicing.

So, what must you do to become a good reader?

Master different levels of reading, from the more superficial to the involved
and analytical. The following blinks will offer you some guidelines on how to
achieve this.

## Elementary reading: before you analyze a book, you have to understand it at the basic level of grammar and vocabulary.

Remember your early days at school, when you had to read seemingly meaningless
sentences such as “The cat sat on the mat”? Without realizing it, you were
taking the first steps toward mastering elementary reading.

Elementary reading is the stage at which the reader can decipher and comprehend
words and sentences in a text. Here, the reader asks themselves the question
“What does the sentence say?”

For example, when children first learn to read, they’re reading and
understanding the text by linking symbols on a page to sounds in order to form
words and sentences. When they can do this, they can then understand the basic
content of those sentences.

In other words, they understand that the letters “c,” “a” and “t” sound like
they do in the word “cat,” that this word is connected to others to form the
sentence “The cat sat on the mat,” and finally, that this sentence relates to
the image of a cat sitting.

This all seems glaringly obvious, doesn’t it? But the key to understanding all
texts well depends on mastering this skill. If you don’t understand what words
and sentences are communicating, you will not be able to go beyond the very
surface of the contents of a book, or even grasp its basic meaning.

For example, imagine reading a book on cats without knowing the word “cat.” It
would simply make no sense.

So, the next time you have to analyze a text, make sure you understand all the basic concepts from the start.
