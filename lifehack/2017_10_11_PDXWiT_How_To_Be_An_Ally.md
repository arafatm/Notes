[Scenario exercises from Tanya Crenshaw](http://www.shiftf9.org/blog/2017/10/10/how-to-be-a-workplace-ally-in-tech)

Intent vs Impact
- ascribe good intentions when feeling excluded
- speak up, but assume goodwill
- Microaggressions vs what is valued in predominant culture
  - ack diff cultures have diff norms

Culture values
- Independt vs Reliant
- Emotional vs Rational
- Efficient vs Careful
- Individual vs Group
- Research vs Experience

Perspective == my values

Microaggression == based on cultural values

Cumulative effect of Microaggression
- individual: makes you feel bad
- interpersonal: makes it hard to work together
- organizational: feeds office culture
- societal: feeds social programs e.g. education, housing etc.

Obstacles to responding to microaggressions
- Personal character: shy, unertain, etc
- Relational: don't want to offend, cause a scence, etc
- Human behavior: Diffusion of responsibility, Evaluation apprehension

How can I be an ally in Tech? CHANGE THE CULTURE

Set new norms:
- Impact > Intent
- distinguish behavior from character
- It's ok to screw up. Be willing to make public mistakes
- Practice

Take Action:
- **Name It**: Ack impact of words, behavior
  - Come from a place of curiosity
- **Interrupt It**: change the subject
  - Good if you're shy or not sure what is happening in the moment
  - calling out the behavior in the moment can be "shaming" which we want to avoid
- **Follow Up In Person**: Talk to the individuals later about the experience
