Like most people, you probably deal with your fair share of [workplace
annoyances](https://www.inc.com/adele-cehrs/try-these-3-tricks-when-dealing-with-difficult-people.html?cid=search).
From the meeting that gets rescheduled _yet again_ to managing your

or navigating the tricky world of team dynamics, your

levels may spike multiple times throughout a single day.

How are some people able to stay calm and productive in response to challenges
while others are easily rattled?

To find answers, let's look to those who have mastered the art of composure
under pressure: The U.S. Navy SEALs.

## How Navy SEALS Reduce Stress

There's no question that U.S. Navy SEALs face some of the most difficult
situations any human could encounter. Because of this, they've developed ways
to apply the emerging science of grit,
[resilience](http://melodywilding.com/come-dysfunctional-family-youd-make-great-entrepreneur/),
and emotional regulation to effectively manage stress.

In fact, neural scans
[show](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/military/sdut-va-study-shows-navy-seals-handle-stress-better-2012mar07-story.html)
that some SEALs have a remarkable ability to remain calm in response to
threatening situations. Their brains respond differently to stress, activating
neural centers related to emotional control instead of ones related to anxiety
and fear.

Their secret? SEALs manage their physiology to better to control their
psychology.

Researchers at Veterans Affairs put it this way:

_Learning to control your physiology, to control your anticipatory responses as
you remain in that situation, are the first steps to controlling your brain's
response._

If you're thinking this is the result of some superhuman ability, think again.
It may come down to managing one important aspect of well-being: your
breathing.

## A Simple Exercise to Help You Stay Calm

A practice that SEAL teams use in times of trouble is one you can borrow at
your desk.

It's called [box
breathing](http://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing#benefits3) or
four-square breathing.

Here's how it works:
1.  Breathe in for four seconds.
2.  Hold air in your lungs for four seconds.
3.  Exhale for four seconds.
4.  Hold your breath, lungs emptied, for four seconds.

You can even find guided visualizations online to assist you in a box breathing
practice if you're just getting started. The beauty of box breathing is that
it's inconspicuous, meaning you can practice it anywhere, at anytime -- during
[negotiations](http://melodywilding.com/how-to-ask-for-a-raise-when-youre-super-nervous-talking-about-money/),
before delivering [tough
feedback](http://melodywilding.com/speak-confidently-meetings-even-youre-anxious/),
or even in the middle of a [frustrating
conversation](http://melodywilding.com/try-mind-trick-deal-annoying-co-workers/),
for example.

Recently I shared this tool with a client who is navigating her team through a
rocky leadership transition. Meetings were fraught with chaos and morale was
slipping, which my client felt responsible for as a manager. These worries were
beginning to take a toll on her. The anxiety followed her home at night. She
found herself becoming increasingly irritable, and knew she had to address it
in a [more productive
way](http://melodywilding.com/control-stress-and-feel-less-anxious-with-emotional-labeling-free-toolkit/).

After practicing box breathing for just a few days, she experienced a major
shift. Because box breathing improved her ability to regulate her emotions, she
felt more [in
control](http://melodywilding.com/control-your-anger-when-work-drives-you-nuts/)
and able to deal with challenges.

With renewed levelheadedness, she could communicate [more
effectively](http://melodywilding.com/stop-using-words-sound-confident-work/)
to advocate for her team during the transition -- even when upstream dynamics
threatened to throw their progress off-course.

Give box breathing a try. Even though you're not on the battlefield, you may
find this time-tested Navy SEAL technique helps you rule the day.
