# EGO IS THE ENEMY BY RYAN HOLIDAY

"I'm just trying to rid the world of all these fevered egos that are taining
our collective uncounscious and making us pay a higher psychic price than we
can imagine" -- Bill Hicks

## THE PAINFUL PROLOGUE

"virtue begins with understanding and is fulfilled by courage" -- Demosthenes

We must begin by seeing ourselves and the world in a new way for the first
time.

**Then we must fight to be different and fight to stay different that's the
hard part**.

## INTRODUCTION

> "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool." -- RICHARD FEYNMAN

The ego we see most commonly goes by a more casual definition: an unhealthy
belief in our own importance. **Arrogance**. **Self-centered ambition**.

Especially for successful people who can't see what ego prevents them from
doing because all they can see is what they've already done.

With every ambition and goal we have big or small ego is there undermining
us on the very journey we've put everything into pursuing.

We can't recognize opportunities or create them if instead of seeing what
is in front of us, we live inside our own fantasy.

> "If you start believing in your greatness, it is the death of your creativity." -- Marina Abromovic 

Just one thing keeps ego around - comfort. Pursuing great work whether it
is in sports or art or business is often terrifying. Ego soothes that fear.
It's a salve to that insecurity.

At any given time in life, people find themselves at one of **three
stages**.
- We're aspiring to something trying
- We have achieved success perhaps a little, perhaps a lot.
- Or we have failed recently or continually.

Three parts that this book is organized into: **Aspire. Success. Failure.**

> help us be: **Humble** in our aspirations. **Gracious** in our success.
**Resilient** in our failures

> **Ego is stolen. Confidence is earned.**

One is girding yourself, the other gaslighting.

## Part I: ASPIRE

### Intro 

> "no adornment so becomes you as modesty, justice, and self-control; for these are the virtues by which, as all men are agreed, the character of the young is held in restraint." -- Isocrates

> "Abhor flatterers as you would deceivers; for both, if trusted, injure those who trust them." -- Isocrates

> "Be affable in your relations with those who approach you, and never haughty; for the pride of the arrogant even slaves can hardly endure" -- Isocrates

> "Be slow in deliberation, but be prompt to carry out your resolves" -- Isocrates

> "Best thing which we have in ourselves is good judgment." -- Isocrates

> "Constantly train your intellect, for the greatest thing in the smallest
compass is a sound mind in a human body." -- Isocrates

> "This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!" -- Shakespeare, Polonius to his son Laertes

> "Talent is only the starting point." -- Irving Berlin

If you want to be more than a flash in the pan, you must be prepared to
focus on the long term.

we will be **action and education focused**, and **forgo validation and
status**, our ambition will not be grandiose but **iterative** one foot in
front of the other, learning and growing and **putting in the time**.

We will **challenge the myth** of the self-assured genius for whom doubt
and introspection is foreign, as well as challenge the myth of pained,
tortured artist who must sacrifice his health for his work.

### TALK, TALK, TALK

> "Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know." -- LAO TZU

Upton Sinclair wrote a book outlining what he would accomplish as governer
before he got the office. He lost the campaign by not focusing on it.

It's easier to talk about doing than to actually do.

Silence is strength particularly early on in any journey.

"Mere gossip anticipates real talk, and to express what is still in thought
weakens action by forestalling it." -- Kierkegaard

Silence is the respite of the confident and the strong.

"Never give reasons for what you think or do until you must. Maybe, after a
while, a better reason will pop into your head." -- Sherman

"A man's best treasure is a thrifty tongue." -- Hesiod

Talk depletes us. Talking and doing fight for the same resources.

Even **talking aloud** to ourselves while we work through difficult
problems has been shown to **significantly decrease insight and
breakthroughs**.

After spending so much time thinking, explaining, and talking about a task,
we start to feel that we've gotten closer to achieving it.

Or worse, when things get tough, we feel we can toss the whole project
aside because we've given it our best try, although of course we haven't.

Success requires a full 100 percent of our effort, and talk flitters part
of that effort away before we can use it.

The greatest work and art comes from **wrestling with the void**, facing it
instead of scrambling to make it go away.

Ignore the impulse to seek recognition before they act.

The only relationship between work and chatter is that one kills the other.

### BE OR TO DO?

"this formative period, the soul is unsoiled by warfare with the world. It
lies, like a block of pure, uncut Parian marble, ready to be fashioned into
what?"  -- ORISON SWETT MARDEN

> "Tiger, one day you will come to a fork in the road, and you're going to have to make a decision about which direction you want to go. If you go that way you can be somebody. You will have to make compromises and you will have to turn your back on your friends. But you will be a member of the club and you will get promoted and you will get good assignments. Or you can go that way and you can do something something for your country and for your Air Force and for yourself. If you decide you want to do something, you may not get promoted and you may not get the good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors. But you won't have to compromise yourself. You will be true to your friends and to yourself. And your work might make a difference. To be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call. That's when you will have to make a decision." -- Forty-Second Boyd (fighter pilot)

"To be or to do? Which way will you go?" -- Forty-Second Boyd (fighter pilot)

Impressing people is utterly different from being truly impressive.

he'd write on the chalkboard in big letters the words: DUTY, HONOR,
COUNTRY.  Then he would cross those words out and replace them with three
others: PRIDE, POWER, GREED.

"A nation is born stoic and dies epicurean." -- Will Durant (Historian)

### BECOME A STUDENT

"Let No Man's Ghost Come Back to Say My Training Let Me Down." --  SIGN IN
THE NEW YORK FIRE DEPARTMENT TRAINING ACADEMY

Kirk Hammett (Metallica) wasn't as good as he'd like to be. Studied under
Joe Satriani.

"The main thing with Kirk . . . was he was a really good guitar
player when he walked in the door. He was already playing lead
guitar . . . he was already shredding. He had a great right hand,
he knew most of his chords, he just didn't learn how to play in an
environment where he learned all the names and how to connect everything
together." -- Joe Satriani

Satriani explained that what separated Hammett from the others was his
willingness to endure the type of instruction they wouldn't.

For the next two years Kirk did as Satriani required, returning every week
for objective feedback, judgment, and drilling in technique and musical
theory.

The power of being a student is not just that it is an extended period of
instruction, it also **places the ego and ambition in someone else's
hands**.

> An education can't be "hacked"; there are no shortcuts besides **hacking it every single day**. If you don't, they drop you. 

The pretense of knowledge is our most dangerous vice, because it prevents
us from getting any better. Studious self-assessment is the antidote.

Frank Shamrock has a system he trains fighters in that he calls plus,
minus, and equal.

"Each fighter, to become great needs to have **someone better that they can
learn from**, **someone lesser who they can teach**, and **someone equal
that they can challenge themselves against**." -- Frank Shamrock (MMA)

"False ideas about yourself destroy you. For me, I always stay a student.
That's what martial arts are about, and you have to use that humility as a
tool. You put yourself beneath someone you trust." -- Fran kShamrock

A student is self-critical and self-motivated, always trying to improve his
understanding so that he can move on to the next topic, the **next
challenge**.

A real student is also his own teacher and his own critic. There is no room
for ego there.

If a fighter is not capable of learning and practicing every day, if he is
not relentlessly looking for areas of improvement, examining his own
shortcomings, and finding new techniques to borrow from peers and
opponents, he will be broken down and destroyed.

> "It is impossible to learn that which one thinks one already knows" -- Epictetus 

You can't learn if you think you already know.

"When student is ready, the teacher appears." -- old proverb

### DON'T BE PASSIONATE

"You seem to want that vivida vis animi which spurs and excites most young
men to please, to shine, to excel. Without the desire and the pains
necessary to be considerable, depend upon it, you never can be so." -- LORD
CHESTERFIELD

Your passion may be the very thing holding you back from power or influence
or accomplishment.

Remember, "zealot" is just a nice way to say "crazy person." -- 

Lewis Alcindor Jr., who won three national championships with John Wooden
at UCLA, used one word to describe the style of his famous coach:
"dispassionate." -- As in not passionate. Wooden wasn't about rah-rah
speeches or inspiration. He saw those extra emotions as a burden. Instead,
his philosophy was about **being in control and doing your job and never
being "passion's slave."**

Napoleon was full of passion invading Russia.

**Passion typically masks a weakness**. Its breathlessness and
impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for **discipline**, for
**mastery**, for **strength** and **purpose** and **perseverance**.

> Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to
pleasuring yourself (passion).

More than purpose, we also need **realism**.

Where do we start? What do we do first? What do we do right now? How are we
sure that what we're doing is moving us forward? What are we benchmarking
ourselves against?

"Great passions are maladies without hope," -- Goethe

Which is why a deliberate, purposeful person operates on a different level,
beyond the sway or the sickness. They hire professionals and use them. They
ask questions, they ask what could go wrong, they ask for examples. They
plan for contingencies. Then they are off to the races.

**Passion is form over function**.

**Purpose is function, function, function**.

> It'd be far better if you were intimidated by what lies ahead humbled by its magnitude and determined to see it through regardless. Leave passion for the amateurs.

Make it about what you feel you must do and say, not what you care about
and wish to be.

### FOLLOW THE CANVAS STRATEGY

"Great men have almost always shown themselves as ready to obey as they
afterwards proved able to command." -- LORD MAHON

The angry, unappreciated genius is forced to do stuff she doesn't like, for
people she doesn't respect, as she makes her way in the world. How dare
they force me to grovel like this! The injustice! The waste!

We see it in an inability to meet anyone else on their terms, an
unwillingness to take a step back in order to potentially take several
steps forward.

I will not let them get one over on me. **I'd rather we both have nothing
instead**.

> **Make other people look good and you will do well**. Keep your head down, they say, and serve your boss.

It's not about kissing ass. It's not about making someone look good. It's
about providing the support so that others can be good.

**Find canvases for other people to paint on**. Be an anteambulo. Clear the
path for the people above you and you will eventually create a path for
yourself.

When you are just starting out, we can be sure of a few **fundamental
realities**:
1. You're **not nearly as good** or as important as you think you are
2. You have an **attitude** that needs to be readjusted
3. Most of what you **think you know** or most of what you learned in books
   or in school is out of date or wrong.

"Say little, do much." -- 

Be lesser, do more. Imagine if for every person you met, you thought of
some way to help them, something you could do for them?

Making a concerted effort to trade your short-term gratification for a
longer-term payoff.

Let the others take their credit on credit, while you defer and earn
interest on the principal.

The canvas strategy is easy. The iterations are endless.
- Maybe it's coming up with ideas to hand over to your boss.
- Find people, thinkers, up-and-comers to introduce them to each other.
- Cross wires to create new sparks.
- Find what nobody else wants to do and do it.
- Find inefficiencies and waste and redundancies.
- Identify leaks and patches to free up resources for new areas.
- Produce more than everyone else and give your ideas away

Consider each one an investment in relationships and in your own
development.

### RESTRAIN YOURSELF

"I have observed that those who have accomplished the greatest results are
those who "keep under the body"; are those who never grow excited or lose
self-control, but are always **calm, self-possessed, patient, and
polite**." -- BOOKER T. WASHINGTON

When Branch Rickey, the manager and owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, scouted
Jackie to potentially become the first black player in baseball, he had one
question: Do you have the guts? "I'm looking," Rickey told him, "for a ball
player with the guts not to fight back." -- 

Rickey playacted the abuse that Robinson was likely to experience if he
accepted Rickey's challenge: a hotel clerk refusing him a room, a rude
waiter in a restaurant, an opponent shouting slurs. This, Robinson assured
him, he was ready to handle.

You cannot, as John Steinbeck once wrote to his editor, "[lose] temper as a
refuge from despair." -- 

It doesn't matter how talented you are, how great your connections are, how
much money you have. When you want to do something something big and
important and meaningful you will be subjected to treatment ranging from
indifference to outright sabotage. Count on it.

You'll want to get in other people's faces, people who don't deserve the
respect, recognition, or rewards they are getting.

> When someone doesn't reckon you with the seriousness that you'd like, the impulse is to correct them.  Instead, you must do nothing. Take it. **Eat it** until you're sick. Endure it.  Quietly brush it off and **work harder**. Play the game.

### GET OUT OF YOUR OWN HEAD

"A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts,
so he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions." -- ALAN
WATTS

We tend to think that ego equals confidence, which is what we need to be in
charge. In fact, it can have the **opposite effect**.

We're all full of anxieties, doubts, impotence, pains, and sometimes a little
tinge of crazy.

Psychologist David Elkind has famously researched, adolescence is marked by a
phenomenon known now as the **imaginary audience**.
- They're convinced that their every move is being watched with rapt
  attention by the rest of the world.
- We stay stuck inside our heads instead of participating in the world around
  us.

What successful people do is **curb such flights of fancy**. They ignore the
temptations that might make them feel important or skew their perspective.

Living clearly and presently takes courage. Don't live in the haze of the
abstract, **live with the tangible and real**, even if especially if it's
uncomfortable. Be part of what's going on around you. Feast on it, adjust for
it.

> **There's no one to perform for**. There is just work to be done and lessons to be learned, in all that is around us.

### THE DANGER OF EARLY PRIDE 

> "A proud man is always looking down on things and people; and, of course, as long as you are looking down, you cannot see something that is above you." -- C. S. LEWIS

**Pride leads to arrogance** and then **away from humility and connection**
with their fellow man.

Pride takes a minor accomplishment and makes it feel like a major one.

**Receive feedback**, **maintain hunger**, and **chart a proper course in
life**. Pride dulls these senses.

"If you can't swallow your pride, you can't lead." -- Genghis Khan grooming
his sons and generals to succeed him

"The first product of self-knowledge is humility" -- Flannery O'Connor

The questions to ask, when you feel pride, then, is this:
- What am I missing right now that a more humble person might see?
- What am I avoiding, or running from, with my bluster, franticness, and
  embellishments?

> Don't boast. There's nothing in it for you.

### WORK, WORK, WORK

"The best plan is only good intentions unless it degenerates into work." --
PETER DRUCKER

"A poet's function is not to experience the poetic state: that is a
private affair. His function is to create it in others." -- Paul Valéry,
philosopher and writer

> "You can't build a reputation on what you're going to do" -- Henry Ford

"That germ of an idea does not make a sculpture which stands up. It just sits
there. So the next stage, of course, is the hard work." -- sculptor Nina
Holton

"The hard thing isn't setting a big, hairy, audacious goal. The hard thing is
laying people off when you miss the big goal. The hard thing isn't
dreaming big. The hard thing is waking up in the middle of the night in a
cold sweat when the dream turns into a nightmare." -- Ben Horowitz, serial
entrepreneur 

You know that all things require work and that work might be quite difficult.

But do you really understand? Do you have any idea just how much work there
is going to be? Not work until you get your big break, not work until you
make a name for yourself, but work, work, work, forever and ever.

> Is it ten thousand hours or twenty thousand hours to mastery? The answer is that it doesn't matter. **There is no end zone**.

Our ego wants the ideas and the fact that we aspire to do something about
them to be enough.

Ego wants the hours we spend planning and attending conferences or chatting
with impressed friends to count toward the tally that success seems to
require.

Do we sit down, alone, and struggle with our work? Work that may or may not
go anywhere

Do we love work, making a living to do work, not the other way around?

Do we love practice, the way great athletes do?

"Fac, si facis." -- (Do it if you're going to do it.)

"Materiam superabat opus." -- (The workmanship was better than the material.)

"Fake it 'til you make it. It's no surprise that such an idea has found
increasing relevance in our noxiously bullshit, Nerf world."  -- popular old
trope

> **Make it so you don't have to fake it**

Work doesn't want to be good. It is made so, despite the headwind.

You know a workman by the chips they leave. It's true. To judge your progress
properly, just **take a look at the floor.**

### FOR EVERYTHING THAT COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY

"Tis a common proof, That lowliness is young ambition's ladder." --
SHAKESPEARE

We are petrified, as the Reverend Dr. Sam Wells put it, that if we are
humble, we will end up "subjugated, trodden on, embarrassed and irrelevant."

"All of us who do creative work . . . we get into it because we have
good taste. But it's like there's a gap, that for the first couple years that
you're making stuff, what you're making isn't so good . . . It's
really not that great. It's trying to be good, it has ambition to be good,
but it's not quite that good. But your taste the thing that got you into the
game your taste is still killer, and your taste is good enough that you can
tell that what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you." --  Ira
Glass, on the **Taste/Talent Gap**

## PART II: SUCCESS

### ALWAYS STAY A STUDENT 

"Every man I meet is my master in some point, and in that I learn of him." --
RALPH WALDO EMERSON

Under Genghis Khan's direction, the Mongols were as **ruthless about stealing
and absorbing the best of each culture they encountered** as they were about
conquest itself.

Genghis personality was "a persistent cycle of pragmatic learning,
experimental adaptation, and constant revision driven by his uniquely
disciplined and focused will."

While the Mongols themselves seemed dedicated almost solely to the art of
war, they put to good use every craftsman, merchant, scholar, entertainer,
cook, and skilled worker they came in contact with.

Mongol empire was remarkable for its religious freedoms, and most of all, for
its love of ideas and convergence of cultures.

> Pick up a book on a topic you know next to nothing about. Put yourself in rooms where you're the least knowledgeable person. Change your mind. Change your surroundings.

An amateur is defensive. The professional finds learning (and even,
occasionally, being shown up) to be enjoyable; they like being challenged and
humbled, and engage in education as an ongoing and endless process.

Peter Drucker says that it's not enough simply to want to learn. As people
progress, they must also understand how they learn and then set up processes
to facilitate this continual education.

### DON'T TELL YOURSELF A STORY 

"Myth becomes myth not in the living but in the retelling." -- DAVID MARANISS

when Bill Walsh took control, he wasn't focused on winning per se.

Bill Walsh's **Standard of Performance**
- What should be done.
- When.
- How.
- Focused on seemingly trivial details
- If the players take care of the details, "the score takes care of itself."

Walsh was strong and confident enough to know that these standards would
eventually contribute to victory. He was also humble enough to know that when
victory would happen was not something he could predict.

Crafting stories out of past events is a very human impulse. It's also
dangerous and untrue.

Writing our own narrative leads to arrogance. It turns our life into a story
and turns us into caricatures while we still have to live it.

Once you win, everyone is gunning for you. It's during your moment at the top
that you can afford ego the least because the stakes are so much higher, the
margins for error are so much smaller.

The founding of a company, making money in the market, or the formation of an
idea is messy. Reducing it to a narrative retroactively creates a clarity
that never was and never will be there.

Investor Paul Graham explicitly warns startups against having bold, sweeping
visions early on.

> Have "frighteningly ambitious" ideas, but explains, "The way to do really big things seems to be to start with deceptively small things." -- Paul Graham 

"Keep your identity small," fits well here. Make it about the work and the
principles behind it not about a glorious vision that makes a good headline.

Napoleon had the words "To Destiny!" engraved on the wedding ring
- Destiny was what he'd always believed
- also why he overreached time and time again,

"A great destiny is great slavery." -- Seneca

We must **shun the false crown** and continue working on what got us here.
Because that's the only thing that will keep us here.

### WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU? 

"To know what you like is the beginning of wisdom and of old age" -- ROBERT
LOUIS STEVENSON

we're never happy with what we have, we want what others have too.

We want to have more than everyone else.

We start out knowing what is important to us, but once we've achieved it, we
lose sight of our priorities.

Ego sways us, and can ruin us.

**Ego leads to envy** and it rots the bones of people big and small.

Competitiveness is an important force in life. It's what drives the market
and is behind some of mankind's most impressive accomplishments. On an
individual level, however, it's absolutely critical that you **know who
you're competing with and why**, that you have a clear sense of the space
you're in.

According to Seneca, the Greek word euthymia is one we should think of often:
it is the **sense of our own path** and how to stay on it without getting
distracted by all the others that intersect it.

In other words, it's not about beating the other guy.

It's about going where you set out to go.

About accomplishing the most that you're capable of in what you choose.

Euthymia means "tranquillity" in English.

If you don't know how much you need, the default easily becomes: more.

You need to know what you don't want and what your choices preclude. Because
strategies are often mutually exclusive.

Life requires those trade-offs, but ego can't allow it.

Find out why you're after what you're after. Ignore those who mess with your
pace. **Let them covet what you have, not the other way around**. Because
that's independence.

### ENTITLEMENT, CONTROL, AND PARANOIA

"One of the symptoms of approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that
one's work is terribly important." -- BERTRAND RUSSELL

With success, particularly power, come some of the greatest and most
dangerous delusions: **entitlement, control, and paranoia.**

We begin to overestimate our own power. Then we lose perspective. Eventually,
we can end like Xerxes, a monstrous joke.

Persistence and courage in the face of ridiculous odds are partially
irrational traits in some cases really irrational. When it works, those
tendencies can feel like they've been vindicated.

We're here because we're bigger, stronger, smarter. That we make the reality
we inhabit.

A critic of Napoleon nailed it when remarking: "He despises the nation whose
applause he seeks." He couldn't help but see the French people as pieces to
be manipulated, people he had to be better than, people who, unless they were
totally, unconditionally supportive of him, were against him.

A smart man or woman must regularly remind themselves of the limits of their
power and reach.

Entitlement assumes: This is mine. I've earned it. At the same time,
entitlement nickels and dimes other people because it can't conceive of
valuing another person's time as highly as its own.

Control says, It all must be done my way even little things, even
inconsequential things. It can become paralyzing perfectionism, or a million
pointless battles fought merely for the sake of exerting its say.

It too exhausts people whose help we need, particularly quiet people who
don't object until we've pushed them to their breaking point.

Paranoia thinks, I can't trust anyone. I'm in this totally by myself and for
myself. It says, I'm surrounded by fools.

"He who indulges empty fears earns himself real fears" -- Seneca

What it really is: a mask for weakness, insecurity, and instability.

### MANAGING YOURSELF 

"It is not enough to have great qualities; we should also have the management
of them." -- LA ROCHEFOUCAULD

"The president does the most important things. I do the next most important
things."

Urgent and important are not synonyms.

His job was to set the priorities, to think big picture, and then trust the
people beneath him to do the jobs they were hired for.

The nature of leadership is less and less about doing and more and more about
making decisions.

This transition requires reevaluating and updating your identity. It requires
a certain humility to put aside some of the more enjoyable or satisfying
parts of your previous job.

It means accepting that others might be more qualified or specialized in
areas in which you considered yourself competent or at least their time is
better spent on them than yours.

Responsibility requires a readjustment and then increased clarity and
purpose.
- First, setting the top-level goals and priorities of the organization and
  your life.
- Then enforcing and observing them. To produce results and only results.

A fish stinks from the head, is the saying. Well, you're the head now.

### BEWARE THE DISEASE OF ME

"If I am not for myself who will be for me? If I am only for myself, who am
I?" -- HILLEL

Great teams tend to follow a trajectory -- Pat Reilly:
- **Innocent Climb**: When they start before they have won a team is
  innocent. If the conditions are right, they come together, they watch out
  for each other and work together toward their collective goal.
- **Disease of Me** After a team starts to win and media attention begins,
  the simple bonds that joined the individuals together begin to fray.

For us, it's beginning to think that we're better, that we're special, that
our problems and experiences are so incredibly different from everyone else's
that no one could possibly understand.

> **Ego needs honors in order to be validated**. Confidence, on the other hand, is able to wait and focus on the task at hand regardless of external recognition.

> "You're becoming who you are going to be and so you might as well not be an
asshole." -- Cheryl Strayed, Writer

Gracious, forgiving, and magnanimous because it is right.

**The credit? Who cares**

### MEDITATE ON THE IMMENSITY 

"A monk is a man who is separated from all and who is in harmony with all."
-- EVAGRIUS PONTICUS

Stoics would call **sympatheia** a connectedness with the cosmos.

"Every man is a quotation from all his ancestors." -- Emerson

"When I look up in the universe, I know I'm small, but I'm also big. I'm big
because I'm connected to the universe and the universe is connected to me."
-- Neil deGrasse Tyson

Creativity is a matter of receptiveness and recognition. This cannot happen
if you're convinced the world revolves around you.

We forget that woolly mammoths walked the earth while the pyramids were being
built.

Cleopatra lived closer to our time than she did to the construction of those
famous pyramids that marked her kingdom.

When British workers excavated the land in Trafalgar Square to build Nelson's
Column and its famous stone lions, in the ground they found the bones of
actual lions, who'd roamed that exact spot just a few thousand years before.

It takes but a chain of six individuals who shook hands with one another
across the centuries to connect Barack Obama to George Washington.

Many of the photos we see from even fifty years ago are still in black and
white, and we seem to assume that the world was in black and white.

"To see a World in a Grain of Sand / And a Heaven in a Wild Flower / Hold
Infinity in the palm of your hand / And Eternity in an hour." -- Blake, poem

- Feel unprotected against the elements or forces or surroundings.
- Remind yourself how pointless it is to rage and fight and try to one-up
  those around you.
- Go and put yourself in touch with the infinite, and end your conscious
  separation from the world.
- Reconcile yourself a bit better with the realities of life.
- Realize how much came before you, and how only wisps of it remain.
- Let the feeling carry you as long as you can.

### MAINTAIN YOUR SOBRIETY 

"The height of cultivation runs to simplicity." -- BRUCE LEE

The ego tells us we're invincible, that we have unlimited force that will
never dissipate. But that can't be what greatness requires energy without
end?

"fight to be the person philosophy tried to make you." -- Marcus Aurelius

DON'T BE DECEIVED BY RECOGNITION YOU HAVE GOTTEN OR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN
YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.

We have to fight to stay sober, despite the many different forces swirling
around our ego.

"Power doesn't so much corrupt; that's too simple. It fragments, closes
options, mesmerizes." -- Shelby Foote, historian

"You can't solve tasks with charisma." -- Angela Merkel

She is rational. She analyzes. She makes it about the situation, not about
herself, as people in power often do.

Elimination of the unnecessary and the destructive.

"It requires a strong constitution to withstand repeated attacks of
prosperity." -- James Basford

Most successful people are people you've never heard of. They want it that
way.  It keeps them sober. It helps them do their jobs.

### FOR WHAT OFTEN COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY 

"The evidence is in, and you are the verdict." -- ANNE LAMOTT

You must manage yourself in order to maintain your success.

Generosity, which we all admire, must stop short of either profligacy and
parsimony in order to be of any use.

"In each case, it is hard work to find the intermediate; for instance, not
everyone, but only one who knows, finds the midpoint in a circle." --
Aristotle

What's difficult is to apply the right amount of pressure, at the right time,
in the right way, for the right period of time, in the right car, going in
the right direction.

Laws of nature say that everything regresses toward the mean.

Instead of letting power make us delusional and instead of taking what we
have for granted, we'd be better to spend our time preparing for the shifts
of fate that inevitably occur in life.

Reversals and regressions are as much a part of the cycle of life as anything
else. But we can manage that too.

## PART III: FAILURE

### Intro

We don't need pity, our own or anyone else's. We need purpose, poise, and
patience.

"It is because mankind are disposed to sympathize more entirely with our joy
than with our sorrow, that we make parade of our riches, and conceal our
poverty. Nothing is so mortifying as to be obliged to expose our distress to
the view of the public, and to feel, that though our situation is open to the
eyes of all mankind, no mortal conceives for us the half of what we suffer."
-- ADAM SMITH

If success is ego intoxication, then failure can be a devastating ego blow
turning

"He will face a battle he knows not, he will ride a road he knows not." --
Gilgamesh

"Almost always, your road to victory goes through a place called 'failure'"
-- Bill Walsh

Ego loves this notion, the idea that something is "fair" or not.
Psychologists call it **narcissistic injury** when we take personally totally
indifferent and objective events.

What matters is that we can respond to what life throws at us. And how we
make it through.

### ALIVE TIME OR DEAD TIME?

"Vivre sans temps mort." -- (Live without wasted time.) PARISIAN POLITICAL
SLOGAN

There are two types of time in our lives: **dead time**, when people are
passive and waiting, and **alive time**, when people are learning and acting
and utilizing every second.

Think of what you have been putting off. Issues you declined to deal with.
Systemic problems that felt too overwhelming to address. Dead time is revived
when we use it as an opportunity to do what we've long needed to do.

Make use of what's around you. Don't let stubbornness make a bad situation
worse.

### THE EFFORT IS ENOUGH

> "What matters to an active man is to do the right thing; whether the right thing comes to pass should not bother him." -- GOETHE

In life, there will be times when we do everything right, perhaps even
perfectly. Yet the results will somehow be negative: failure, disrespect,
jealousy, or even a resounding yawn from the world.

Will we work hard for something that can be taken away from us? Will we
invest time and energy even if an outcome is not guaranteed? With the right
motives we're willing to proceed. With ego, we're not.

We have only minimal control over the rewards for our work and effort other
people's validation, recognition, rewards.

So what are we going to do? Not be kind, not work hard, not produce, because
there is a chance it wouldn't be reciprocated?

"It is a sore thing to have labored along and scaled arduous hilltops, and
when all is done, find humanity indifferent to your achievement." -- Robert
Louis Stevenson

> You will be unappreciated. You will be sabotaged. You will experience surprising failures. Your expectations will not be met. You will lose. You will fail.

John Wooden's advice to his players says it: Change the definition of
success.

"Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in
knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are
capable of becoming." -- John Wooden

"Ambition means tying your well-being to what other people say or
do. Sanity means tying it to your own actions." -- Marcus Aurelius

We can't let externals determine whether something was worth it or not. It's
on us.

The world is, after all, indifferent to what we humans "want." If we persist
in wanting, in needing, we are simply setting ourselves up for resentment or
worse. **Doing the work is enough.**

### FIGHT CLUB MOMENTS

"If you shut up truth and bury it under the ground, it will but grow, and
gather to itself such explosive power that the day it bursts through it will
blow up everything in its way." -- EMILE ZOLA

We surround ourselves with bullshit. With distractions. With lies about what
makes us happy and what's important.

"Uris dura franguntur" -- (Hard things are broken by hard things)

The bigger the ego the harder the fall.

"The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken
places.  But those that will not break it kills." -- A Farewell to Arms

> "A team, like men, must be brought to its knees before it can rise again." -- Vince Lombardi

> In the end, the only way you can appreciate your progress is to **stand on the edge of the hole you dug for yourself**, look down inside it, and smile fondly at the bloody claw prints that marked your journey up the walls.

### DRAW THE LINE

"It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character" -- MARCUS AURELIUS

People make mistakes all the time.

This is all perfectly fine; it's what being an entrepreneur or a creative or
even a business executive is about.

We take risks. We mess up. The problem is that when we get our identity tied
up in our work, we worry that any kind of failure will then say something bad
about us as a person.

It's the **sunk cost fallacy**

And so we throw good money and good life after bad and end up making
everything so much worse.

Shit happens and, as they say, sometimes shit happens in public. It's not
fun.  The questions remain: Are you going to make it worse? Or are you going
to emerge from this with your dignity and character intact?

> "He who fears death will never do anything worthy of a living man" -- Seneca

### MAINTAIN YOUR OWN SCORECARD

"I never look back, except to find out about mistakes . . . I only
see danger in thinking back about things you are proud of." -- ELISABETH
NOELLE-NEUMANN

This is characteristic of how great people think. It's not that they find
failure in every success. They just hold themselves to a standard that
exceeds what society might consider to be objective success. Because of that,
they don't much care what other people think; they care whether they meet
their own standards. And these standards are much, much higher than everyone
else's.

Winning is not enough. **People can get lucky and win**. People can be
assholes and win. Anyone can win. But **not everyone is the best possible
version of themselves**.

"There are two different occasions upon which we examine our own conduct, and
endeavour to view it in the light in which the impartial spectator would view
it: first, when we are about to act; and secondly, after we have acted. Our
views are apt to be very partial in both cases; but they are apt to be most
partial when it is of most importance that they should be otherwise. When we
are about to act, the eagerness of passion will seldom allow us to consider
what we are doing, with the candour of an indifferent person. When the
action is over, indeed, and the passions which prompted it have subsided, we
can enter more coolly into the sentiments of the indifferent spectator." --
Adam Smith, theory for how wise and good people evaluate their actions

A person who judges himself based on his own standards doesn't crave the
spotlight the same way as someone who lets applause dictate success.

A person who can think long term doesn't pity herself during short-term
setbacks.

A person who values the team can share credit and subsume his own interests
in a way that most others can't.

### ALWAYS LOVE

"And why should we feel anger at the world? As if the world would notice!" --
EURIPIDES

"An attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the
unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually
facilitated by the Internet." -- **Streisand effect**

Attempting to destroy something out of hate or ego often ensures that it will
be preserved and disseminated forever.

You know what is a better response to an attack or a slight or something you
don't like? **Love**.

You could at the very least try to let it go. You could try to shake your
head and laugh about it.

> "They cannot degrade Frederick Douglass. The soul that is within me no man can degrade. I am not the one that is being degraded on account of this treatment, but those who are inflicting it upon me." -- Frederick Douglas

Are we going to be miserable just because other people are?

**Obsession with the past**, with something that someone did or how things
should have been, as much as it hurts, is **ego embodied**.

Everyone else has moved on, but you can't, because you can't see anything but
your own way. You can't conceive of accepting that someone could hurt you,
deliberately or otherwise. So you hate.

It's so **easy to hate**. **Hate defers blame**. It makes **someone else
responsible**.

### FOR EVERYTHING THAT COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY

"I don't like work no man does but I like what is in the work the chance to
find yourself." -- JOSEPH CONRAD

> "People learn from their failures. Seldom do they learn anything from success." -- Harold Geneen

> "See much, study much, suffer much, that is the path to wisdom." -- old Celtic saying

Wisdom or ignorance? Ego is the swing vote.

Not to aspire or seek out of ego. To have success without ego. To **push
through failure with strength, not ego**.

## EPILOGUE

"There is something of a civil war going on within all of our lives. There is
a recalcitrant South of our soul revolting against the North of our soul. And
there is this continual struggle within the very structure of every
individual life." -- MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.

It is no easy task to go head-to-head with one's ego. To accept first that
ego may be there. Then to subject it to scrutiny and criticism.

Daniele Bolelli once gave me a helpful metaphor. He explained that training
was like sweeping the floor. Just because we've done it once, doesn't mean
the floor is clean forever.

> "Every day the dust comes back. Every day we must sweep." -- Daniele Bolelli

The same is true for ego.

> **But for the grace of God go I. But for the grace of God, that could be any of us**

Every day for the rest of your life you will find yourself at one of three
phases: aspiration, success, failure. You will battle the ego in each of
them. You will make mistakes in each of them.
