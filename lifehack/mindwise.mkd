# Mindwise: Why We Misunderstand What Others Think, Believe, Feel, and Want by Nicholas Epley

### Prologue

The bigger the social groups, the bigger cerebral cortex you need

cerebral cortexes of monkeys actually appear to grow larger when they’re housed 
in larger social groups,

being a social savant requires practice, work, and some thoughtful strategies.

## PART 1 (MIS)READING MINDS

### 1 An Overconfident Sense

people occasionally misunderstand each other.

times when others have misunderstood _your_ thoughts, emotions, or intentions.

Seeing someone for only fifty milliseconds, faster than the blink of an eye, 
gives us enough time to form an impression of their competence. These snap 
judgments matter.

#### MIRROR, MIRROR

Much of our everyday life is spent trying to understand how we’re being 
evaluated in order to help us create just the right impression.

Although you might have some sense of how smart your coworkers think you are, 
you appear to have no clue about which coworkers _in particular_ find you smart 
and which do not.

studies found that people are only slightly better than chance at guessing who 
in a group likes them and who does not

Some of your coworkers like you and others do not, but I wouldn’t count on you 
knowing the difference.

Asked to predict how attractive they would be rated by a member of the opposite 
sex who was evaluating a photograph we took of them, we found that people’s 
predictions were no more accurate than chance guessing.

people’s ability to spot deception was only a few percentage points better than 
a random coin flip:

#### ILLUSIONS OF INSIGHT

We are better able to read the minds of close friends and loved ones than those 
of strangers, although not by all that much.

"strangers read each other with an average accuracy rate of 20 percent"

"Close friends and married couples nudge that up to 35 percent."

Getting to know someone, even over a lifetime of marriage, creates an illusion 
of insight that far surpasses actual insight.

Bigger than the gap between actual accuracy and chance accuracy was the gap 
between how much partners actually knew about each other and how much they 
believed they knew.

the length of a couple’s relationship was _not_ correlated with accuracy. it 
just gave them the illusion that they were more accurate.
