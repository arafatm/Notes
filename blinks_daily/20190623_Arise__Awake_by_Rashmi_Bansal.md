# Arise, Awake
*Rashmi Bansal*

>Arise, Awake (2015) introduces readers to some of Indiaâ€™s most inspiring up-and-coming entrepreneurs. Drawn from a wide variety of different educational and geographical backgrounds, these young guns have established themselves in industries as diverse as the construction sector, student housing and fast food. The one thing they have in common? They took matters into their own hands rather than waiting for the perfect opportunity to drop into their laps.
