# Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity

by *Kim Scott*

It’s brutally hard to tell people when they are screwing up.

You no longer just think the work is bad: you think the person is bad.

They began to wonder if I knew the difference between great and mediocre;

Wanting to make it safe to “speak truth to power” at all levels of the

designed “manager feedback sessions.”

all teams need stability as well as growth to function properly; nothing works
well if everyone is gunning for the next promotion.

called the people on her team who got exceptional results but who were on a
more gradual growth trajectory “rock stars” because they were like the Rock of
Gibraltar on her team. These people loved their work and were world-class at
it, but they didn’t want her job or to be Steve Jobs.

people who were on a steeper growth trajectory—the ones who’d go crazy if they
were still doing the same job in a year—she called “superstars.” They were the
source of growth on any team.

# PART I A NEW MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY

## 1. BUILD RADICALLY CANDID RELATIONSHIPS 

*Bringing your whole self to work*

IT’S CALLED MANAGEMENT, AND IT’S YOUR JOB

Every time I feel I have something more “important” to do than listen to people, I remember Leslie’s words: “It is your job!”

Bosses guide a team to achieve results.

Guidance is often called “feedback.”

Building a cohesive team means figuring out the right people for the right roles: hiring, firing, promoting.

Guidance, team, and results: these are the responsibilities of any boss.

RELATIONSHIPS, NOT POWER, DRIVE YOU FORWARD

three responsibilities as a manager: 1) to create a culture of guidance (praise and criticism) that will keep everyone moving in the right direction; 2) to understand what motivates each person on your team well enough to avoid burnout or boredom and keep the team cohesive; and 3) to drive results collaboratively.

Your relationships with your direct reports affect the relationships they have with their direct reports, and your team’s culture.

Your ability to build trusting, human connections with the people who report directly to you will determine the quality of everything that follows.

RADICAL CANDOR

The first dimension is about being more than “just professional.”

It’s about giving a damn, sharing more than just your work self, and encouraging everyone who reports to you to do the same.

“Care Personally.”

The second dimension involves telling people when their work isn’t good enough—and when it is;

Delivering hard feedback, making hard calls about who does what on a team, and holding a high bar for results—isn

“Challenge Directly.”

when people trust you and believe you care about them, they are much more likely to 1) accept and act on your praise and criticism; 2) tell you what they really think about what you are doing well and, more importantly, not doing so well; 3) engage in this same behavior with one another, meaning less pushing the rock up the hill again and again; 4) embrace their role on the team; and 5) focus on getting results.

CARE PERSONALLY: THE FIRST DIMENSION OF RADICAL CANDOR

Only when you actually care about the whole person with your whole self can you build a relationship.

CHALLENGE DIRECTLY: THE SECOND DIMENSION OF RADICAL CANDOR

quote from John Stuart Mill: The source of everything respectable in man either as an intellectual or as a moral being [is] that his errors are corrigible. He is capable of rectifying his mistakes, by discussion and experience. Not by experience alone. There must be discussion, to show how experience is to be interpreted.

if nobody is ever mad at you, you probably aren’t challenging your team enough.

The key, as in any relationship, is how you handle the anger.

When what you say hurts, acknowledge the other person’s pain. Don’t pretend it doesn’t hurt or say it “shouldn’t” hurt—just show that you care.

The hardest part of building this trust is inviting people to challenge you, just as directly as you are challenging them.

Building enough trust between people to enable reciprocal challenge irrespective of reporting relationship takes time and attention.

“If we have the data about what works, let’s look at the data, but if all we have are opinions, let’s use yours,”

WHAT RADICAL CANDOR IS NOT

not a license to be gratuitously harsh or to “front-stab.

To be Radically Candid, you need to practice it “up,” “down,” and “sideways.”

RADICAL CANDOR IS UNIVERSALLY HUMAN, BUT INTERPERSONALLY AND CULTURALLY RELATIVE

We have to be constantly aware of the fact that what seemed Radically Candid to one person or team may feel too obnoxious (or too touchy-feely) to another.

## 2. GET, GIVE, AND ENCOURAGE GUIDANCE Creating a culture of open communication

THE “UM” STORY

She said I “sounded” stupid rather than I was stupid.

she offered tangible help.

two dimensions to good guidance: care personally and challenge directly.

Radical Candor.

(Ruinous Empathy),

(Obnoxious Aggression),

(Manipulative Insincerity).

walk through the quadrants.

RADICAL CANDOR

established that he cared, that he wasn’t judging me.

Next, he gave me a really direct challenge.

“It’s not mean, it’s clear!”

Radically Candid praise “I admire that about you”

giving really specific praise is important,

“I really admire that you are a Little League coach,”

compliment had not been specific

Giving meaningful praise is hard.

“Because in fact I really admire that you are a Little League coach. You do as good a job integrating your work and your life as anyone I know. I always wonder if I’m spending enough time with my kids, and the example you set by coaching helps me do better. Also, the things you’ve learned from the Positive Coaching Alliance have been enormously helpful in our work.”

comment was contextualized, far more personal, and specific.

Radically Candid criticism To keep winning, criticize the wins

The secret to winning, he said, is to point out to great players what they could have done better, even when they have just won a game. Especially when they have just won

OBNOXIOUS AGGRESSION

WHEN YOU CRITICIZE someone without taking even two seconds to show you care, your guidance feels obnoxiously aggressive

regret to say that if you can’t be Radically Candid, being obnoxiously aggressive is the second best thing you can do.

This explains the advantage that assholes seem to have in the world.

If more people can be Radically Candid, there will be less reason to tolerate Obnoxious Aggression.

most people would rather work for a “competent asshole” than a “nice incompetent.”

Fortunately, the “asshole or incompetent” thing is a false dichotomy:

The worst kind of Obnoxious Aggression happens when one person really understands another’s vulnerabilities and then targets them,

Obnoxiously aggressive criticism Front-stabbing

fundamental attribution error,

Obnoxious Aggression is a behavior, not a personality trait. Nobody is a bona fide asshole all the time.

Fundamental human decency is something every person owes every other, regardless of position.

point here is that I shouldn’t have been talking about Larry’s character, either positively or negatively. I was personalizing.

Obnoxiously aggressive praise Belittling compliments

MANIPULATIVE INSINCERITY

happens when you don’t care enough about a person to challenge directly.

People give praise and criticism that is manipulatively insincere when they are too focused on being liked or think they can gain some sort of political advantage by being fake—or when they are just too tired to care or argue any more.

“He’ll be happy if I tell him I liked his stupid presentation, and that will make my life easier than explaining why it sucked.

Colin Powell said leadership is sometimes about being willing to piss people off.

Give a damn about the people you challenge. Worrying about whether or not they give a damn about you, however, is not “caring personally”

Manipulatively insincere praise The false apology

RUINOUS EMPATHY

THERE’S A RUSSIAN anecdote about a guy who has to amputate his dog’s tail but loves him so much that he cuts it off an inch each day, rather than all at once.

When bosses are too invested in everyone getting along, they also fail to encourage the people on their team to criticize one another for fear of sowing discord.

They create the kind of work environment where “being nice” is prioritized at the expense of critiquing, and therefore, improving actual performance.

Ruinously empathetic praise “Just trying to say something nice”

when giving praise, investigate until you really understand who did what and why it was so great.

Be as specific and thorough with praise as with criticism. Go deep into the details.

MOVING TOWARD RADICAL CANDOR

start with praise, not criticism.

Start by asking for criticism, not by giving it Don’t dish it out before you show you can take it

Bosses get Radically Candid guidance from their teams not merely by being open to criticism but by actively soliciting it.

If you see somebody criticizing a peer inappropriately, say something.

But if somebody criticizes you inappropriately, your job is to listen with the intent to understand and then to reward the candor.

Toyota’s leaders painted a big red square on the assembly line floor. New employees had to stand in it at the end of their first week, and they were not allowed to leave until they had criticized at least three things on the line.

Balance praise and criticism Worry more about praise, less about criticism—but above all be sincere

“shit sandwich.”

the average child sees through it just as clearly as an executive does.

Understand the perilous border between Obnoxious Aggression and Radical Candor “Your work is shit”

for criticism to be effective, it’s crucial “to do it very clearly and to articulate why … and to get them back on track.”

ask for criticism before giving it, and offer more praise than criticism.

the need for honest communication doesn’t always wait until you’ve built a close personal relationship, and even a near-stranger’s silence invites more awkwardness and mistrust

## 3. UNDERSTAND WHAT MOTIVATES EACH PERSON ON YOUR TEAM 

*Helping people take a step in the direction of their dreams*

RETHINKING AMBITION

Rock stars are solid as a rock. Think the Rock of Gibraltar, not Bruce Springsteen. The rock stars love their work. They have found their groove.

Superstars, on the other hand, need to be challenged and given new opportunities to grow constantly.

GROWTH TRAJECTORY     GRADUAL GROWTH TRAJECTORY Change agent     Force for stability Ambitious at work     Ambitious outside of work or simply content in life Want new opportunities     Happy in the current role “Superstar”     “Rock Star”

Unfortunately, for too long I believed that pushing everybody to grow super-fast was simply “best practice”

it never occurred to me that some people did not want the next, bigger job.

performance-potential matrix that so many companies use for succession planning

This matrix asks managers to assess both the performance and the potential of all employees and then put them into one of nine boxes—

proposed using the word “growth” instead of “potential,”

Changing one word made a world of difference.

Instead of asking an implicitly judgmental question like, “Is this a person with high or low potential?” we encouraged managers to ask themselves questions like, “What growth trajectory does each person on my team want to be on right now?” or “Have I given everybody opportunities that are in line with what they really want?” or “What growth trajectory do my direct reports believe they are on? Do I agree? And if I don’t, why don’t I?”

GROWTH MANAGEMENT

The most important thing you can do for your team collectively is to understand what growth trajectory each person wants to be on at a given time and whether that matches the needs and opportunities of the team.

you are going to have to get to know each of your direct reports at a personal level.

require you to have some of the hardest conversations

Sometimes, you’ll even have to fire people.

The axes of this framework are past performance and future growth trajectories.

It’s just as good to be in the bottom-right quadrant as in the upper-right.

Rock stars are just as important to a team’s performance as superstars.

Stability is just as important as growth.

Performance is not a permanent label. No person is always an “excellent performer.” They just performed excellently last quarter.

UNDERSTANDING WHAT MATTERS AND WHY

Most people shift between a steep growth trajectory and a gradual growth trajectory in different phases of their lives and careers,

THE PROBLEM WITH “PASSION”

Insisting that people have passion for their job can place unnecessary pressure on both boss and employee.

Plutarch laid bricks. Spinoza ground lenses. Tedium is part of life.”

Financial Times writer Lucy Kellaway explained why she chose to work for the companies she did: “I went for JPMorgan and later for the FT because they were the only companies offering me a job. It seemed a great reason to pick them then. It is still a great reason today.”

“Only about five percent of people have a real vocation in life, and they confuse the hell out of the rest of us.”

your job is not to provide purpose but instead to get to know each of your direct reports well enough to understand how each one derives meaning from their work.

Christopher Wren, the architect responsible for rebuilding St. Paul’s Cathedral after the Great Fire of London, explains what I mean. Wren was walking the length of the partially rebuilt cathedral when he asked three bricklayers what they were doing. The first bricklayer responded, “I’m working.” The second said, “I’m building a wall.” The third paused, looked up, and then said, “I’m building a cathedral to the Almighty.”

Wren’s role was to listen, to recognize the significance of what he heard, and to create working conditions that allowed everybody to find meaning in their own way.

EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE

Keep your top performers top of mind

One of the most common mistakes bosses make is to ignore the people who are doing the best work because “they don’t need me”

them. Ridiculous, right?” he exclaimed. “Imagine if I went home and told my wife, ‘I don’t want to micromanage you, so I’m not going to spend any time with you or the kids this year.’”

EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE/GRADUAL GROWTH TRAJECTORY

Recognize, reward, but don’t promote

we all have periods in our lives when our professional growth speeds up or slows down.

Promotion often puts these people in roles they are not as well-suited for or don’t want.

key is to recognize their contribution in other ways.

bonus or a raise.

get them to present at your all-hands

get them to help new people learn

if they are shy, make sure that you and others on the team thank them privately

Consider, carefully, tenure awards.

Fair performance ratings

often that rock stars get lower ratings than they should.

If one person is doing much better work than others on the team, it seems obvious they should get a better rating and a higher bonus. But when ratings are primarily used to justify future promotions, rather than to recognize past performance, this doesn’t happen.

Recognition

great way to recognize people in a rock star phase is to designate them as “gurus,” or “go-to” experts.

In World War II, the U.S. Air Force took their very best pilots from the front lines and sent them home to train new pilots.

The Germans lost their air superiority because they flew all their aces until they were shot down;

At Google and many other Silicon Valley companies, being in the same role for too long was a badge of shame.

Steve Jobs, on the other hand, paid close attention to retention and talked warmly about people who’d been with Apple for a long time.

Respect

Before T. S. Eliot was able to make a living as a publisher, he was a clerk at Lloyd’s Bank.

Eliot was focused on writing poetry that would eventually win him a Nobel Prize, not on becoming a branch manager.

He needed a steady income

so that he could go home in the evenings and write.

The idea of climbing a corporate ladder is not inspiring to plenty of people.

The dangers of promotion obsession

The Peter Principle.

EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE/ STEEP GROWTH TRAJECTORY

Keep superstars challenged

Ecclesiastes: “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.”

Keep them challenged (and figure out who’ll replace them when they move on)

The best way to keep superstars happy is to challenge them and make sure they are constantly learning.

It’s vital not to “squash” these people. Recognize that you’ll probably be working for them one day, and celebrate that fact.

Not every superstar wants to manage

Often the matrix is not just analyzing “potential” but “leadership potential.” The unintended consequence of this is that whole armies of people systematically cap the careers of others who are on a steep growth trajectory but who don’t want to become managers.

When management is the only path to higher compensation, the quality of management suffers, and the lives of the people who work for these reluctant managers become miserable.

MANAGING THE MIDDLE

Raise the bar—there’s no such thing as a B-player

Everyone can be excellent at something.

That’s very different from saying anyone can be good at anything—definitely not true.

lots of people never find work they are truly excellent at because they stay in the wrong job so long that any change would require a step or two backward.

POOR PERFORMANCE/ NEGATIVE GROWTH TRAJECTORY Part ways
