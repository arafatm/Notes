# The Lean Startup How Today ’s Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses by Eric Ries

## Overview

The Lean Startup presents a practical and insightful approach to building products and launching startups.  Based on his experience as an entrepreneur and drawing concepts from lean manufacturing and other disciplines, Ries has created a framework for systematic innovatio n to maximize the chances of startup success.

## Introduction

5 principles of the Lean Startup method:
1.  Entrepreneurs are everywhere
2.  Entrepreneurship is management for uncertain conditions
3.  Validated learning
4.  Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop
5.  Innovation accounting

## Chapter 1: Start

Startups should be like driving a car, constantly adjusting direction and
speed.

**Vision** is the foundation of the startup, the reason for existence, the
ultimate goal. The vision rarely changes.

**Strategy** is how to achieve that vision. Strategy includes architecting the
business model, building the product roadmap and responding to the market and
competitors. Occasionally, the strategy may need to be changed, or "pivoted"

**Product** is the end result produced by vision and strategy. The product is
constantly evolving.

Lean Startup methods can be unconventional and uncomfortable, so expect some
organizational resistance.

### Chapter 2: Define

**Startup**: A human institution designed t o create a new product or service
under conditions of extreme uncertainty .

1. Human institution: A startup is much more than an idea, technology or
   product. Human factors such as hiring talent, managing teams and creating
   culture are critical.
2. Product or service: This broadly includes anything that a customer values,
   including intangibles like customer service.
3. Extreme uncertainty: Creating something new and untested where customers and
   markets are unknown or unestablished.

Examples: the story of Snap Tax; Intuit’s innovation testing cycle.

## Chapter 3: Learn

Example: Learning from IMVU’s mistakes.

**Validated learning**:
1. Using scientific methods to test hypotheses and measure results with key
   metrics
2. Constantly focusing on reducing waste

*Fight the temptation of zero.*

## Chapter 4: Experiment

4 reasons experiments are better than research:
1. Market studies and surveys are inaccurate
2. Lean S tartup experimen ts are quick and inexpensive
3. Direct feedba ck from customers is valuable
4. The experiment is the first product.

**Value hypothesis**: Does the product or service deliver value to customers?

**Growth hypothesis**: How will the product or service spread and grow?

3 steps to run a Lean Startup experiment:
1. **Prepare**: Articulate your value and growth hypothese s. Predict quantitative
   metrics that define success or failure. It is not an experiment unless you
   can fail.
2. **Test**: Create and run the test as quickly and inexpensively as possible.
3. **Measure**: Collect data and customer feedback. See if the results va lidate or
   invalidate the hypothesis. Experiment again.

Examples: Zappos, Kodak Gallery.

## Chapter 5: Leap

Value and growth assumptions are called “leap of faith” assumptions because
their validity determines whether a startup will succeed or fail.

Always test the riskiest assumptions first . There is no point in spending
resources testing less risky assumptions if there is a larger risk that could
invalidate the entire venture.

*Genchi Genbutsu* (“go and see for yourself” or “get out of the building”):
venture into the real world and learn directly from by observing, interacting
with, and testing the product or service on customers.

Example: the Toyota Sienna Minivan.

A customer archetype or persona is a portrait of a potential customer group
based on characteristics, behaviors, preferences, needs and wants.

## Chapter 6: Test

**Minimum viable product (“MVP”)**: The minimum set of features required to
test a startup ’s leap of faith assumptions. The MVP’s purpose is to get
through the **Build-Measure-Learn** feedback cycle as quickly and efficiently
as possible.

Examples: Groupon and The Point, video MVP at Dropbox, concierge MVP at Food on
the Table , Wizard of Oz test at Aardvark.

"If we do not know who the customer is, we do not know what quality is." – Eric
Ries.

Example: IMVU’s walk-around workaround.

4 misguided fears about MVPs: competitors, branding, morale, patent protection.

## Chapter 7: Measure

**Vanity metrics**: Metrics that feel good but provide no insight into
improving the business.

**Actionable metrics**: Metrics that report on key drivers of a business, and
can be used to make improve ments.

3 A’s of innovation accounting: actionable, accessible, auditable

3 steps of innovation accounting:
1. Establish a b aseline
2. Tune the engine: change and optimize the business towards a goal
3. Pivot or persevere

3 tools of innovation accounting:
1.  A/B testing
2.  Cohort analysis
3.  Kanban for Lean Startups

A/B testing guidelines:
1. Test one change at a time
2. Run A/B tests on every new product feature
3. Combine A/B testing with qualitative research

A/B testing examples: IMVU, GrockIt.

Benefits of Kanban for Lean Startups:
1. Minimizes work-in-process (WIP)
2. Identifies bottlenecks
3. Forces task completion
4. Promotes cross-functional teamwork

## Chapter 8: Pivot (or Persevere)

**Pivot**: "A structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental
hypothesis about the product, strategy or engine of growth" – Eric Ries

Symptoms that indicate a need to pivot:
- Innovation accounting metrics keep falling short of goals
- Optimization efforts are becoming less effective
- Product development feels unproductive

5 points about pivots:
1.  Pivots need innovation accounting
2.  Pivots take courage
3.  Iterate quickly and avoid “ sunk cost ” thinking
4.  Hold regular “ pivot or persevere ” meetings
5.  Runway is the number of pivots left

Case Studies: Votizen, Wealthfront.

10 types of pivots: zoom-in, zoom-out, customer segment, customer need,
platform, business architecture, value capture, engine of growth, channel,
technology.

## Chapter 9: Batch

**Single piece flow**: Working on one item at a time to completion.
- Benefits of single piece flow:
- Faster overall production process
- First item is produced more quickly
- Problems are detected sooner which reduces rework
- Less inventory in the system

Benefits of **small batches** in Lean Startups:
- Deliver a minimum viable product to the customer sooner
- Create and test new features and receive feedback sooner
- Cycle through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop faster

**Continuous deployment**: A process of constantly making product changes in small
batches.

**Andon cord**: A  mechanism to identify and fix problems immediately

Example: IMVU’s “immune system.”

Principles of small batches can be applied outside of software in physical
products through low cost manufacturing and rapid prototyping

Example: SGW Designworks

Pull hypotheses: start with a hypothesis about the customer and create an
experiment to test it.

## Chapter 10: Grow

**Sustainable growth**: "New customers come from the actions of past customers"

4 types of sustainable growth:
1.Word of mouth
2.Side effect of product use
3.Funded advertising
4.Repeat purchase or use

3 engines of growth:
1. **Sticky**: Attract and retain customers
    Growth Rate = Customer Acquisition Rate – Churn Rate
2. **Viral**: Spread exponentially through customer use
    Viral Coefficient = Addition al New Customers / Customers Acquired`
3. **Paid**: Spend money to acquire customers, usually through paid advertising
     Marginal Profit = Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) – Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)

Viral Example: Hotmail.

Every engine of growth eventually runs out, so be prepared to find new engines
of growth.

## Chapter 11: Adapt

**5 Whys**: Asking "why?" five times in succession can help get to the root of a
problem

**Proportional investments**: Investments to solve problems should be small
when the problem is small and large when the problem is large

5 Whys requires a culture open to admitting mistakes

**Simplified 5 Whys**: Be tolerant of all mistakes the first time, but never allow
the same mistake to be made twice

Tips for 5 Whys
1. Prepare to face unpleasant truths
2. Start small and be specific
3. Focus on today, not yesterday
4. Appoint a 5 Whys master
5. Be inclusive and open

## Chapter 12: Innovate

**Portfolio thinking**: Large companies should cultivate a portfolio of
internal startup projects

3 requirements for internal startup innovation:
1. Scarce but secure resources
2. Autonomy and authority
3. Personal stake in the outcome

Protect the parent organization

Don’t hide internal startups

Create an innovation sandbox with the following parameters: authority,
autonomy, size limit, time limit, customer limit, accountability, monitoring

4 stages of a product or company:
1. Innovation
2. Growth
3. Maturity
4. Legacy

"Entrepreneur" should be a job title inside large companies.

## Epilogue

Lean Startup is a mindset:
- Seek out truth and learning by rigorously testing hypotheses
- Respond to failures with honesty and learning
- Don’t create waste
