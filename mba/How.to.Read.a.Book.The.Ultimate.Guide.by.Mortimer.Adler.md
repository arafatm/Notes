# How to Read a Book: The Ultimate Guide by Mortimer Adler

As part of our [series on reading](https://fs.blog/reading/), this guide dives
into how to read a book using the classical framework provided by Mortimer
Adler.

By the time you finish reading, you’ll have a framework for reading at
different levels that you can apply right away.

Let’s hit the books and explore the following:

## How We Learn To Read

I bet you already know how to read a book. You were taught in elementary
school.

But do you know how to read _well_?

There is a difference between reading for understanding and reading for
information.

If you’re like most people, you probably haven’t given much thought to _how_
you read. And how you read makes a massive difference to knowledge
accumulation.

A lot of people confuse [knowing the name of
something](https://fs.blog/2015/01/richard-feynman-knowing-something/) with
understanding. While great for exercising your memory, the regurgitation of
facts without solid understanding and context gains you little in the real
world.

A useful heuristic: **Anything easily digested is reading for information.**

Consider the newspaper, are you truly learning anything new? Do you consider
the writer your superior when it comes to knowledge in the subject? Odds are
probably not. That means you’re reading for information. It means you’re likely
to parrot an opinion that isn’t yours as if [you had done the
work](https://fs.blog/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/).

This is how most people read. But most people aren’t really learning anything
new. It’s not going to give you an edge, make you better at your job, or allow
you to avoid problems.

### “Marking a book is literally an experience of your differences or agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him.”

— Edgar Allen Poe

Learning something insightful requires mental work. It’s uncomfortable. If it
doesn’t hurt, you’re not learning. You need to find writers who are more
knowledgeable on a particular subject than yourself. By narrowing the gap
between the author and yourself, [you get

## The Four Levels of Reading

**Mortimer Adler** literally wrote [the book on
reading](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671212095/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0671212095&linkId=95f640336f1079ee3b5acafcc3a34a84).

Adler identifies four levels of reading:
1. Elementary Reading
2. Inspectional Reading
3. Analytical Reading
4. Syntopical Reading

## How You Read Matches Why You’re Reading

The goal of reading determines how you read. Reading the latest Danielle Steel
novel is not the same as reading Plato. If you’re reading for entertainment or
information, you’re going to read a lot differently (and likely different
material) than reading to increase understanding. While many people are
proficient in reading for information and entertainment, few improve their
ability to read for knowledge.

Before we can improve our reading skills, we need to understand the differences
in the reading levels. They are thought of as levels because you can’t move to
a higher level without a firm understanding of the previous one — they are
cumulative.

## 1. Elementary Reading

This is the level of reading taught in our elementary schools. If you’re
reading this website, you already know how to do this.

## 2. Inspectional Reading

We’ve been taught that skimming and superficial reading are bad for
understanding. That is not necessarily the case. Using these tools effectively
can increase understanding. Inspectional reading allows us to look at the
author’s blueprint and evaluate the merits of a deeper reading experience.

There are two sub-types of inspectional reading:

* **Systematic skimming —** This is meant to be a quick check of the book by
  (1) reading the preface; (2) studying the table of contents; (3) checking the
  index; and (4) reading the inside jacket. This should give you sufficient
  knowledge to understand the chapters in the book, pivotal to the author’s
  argument. Dip in here and there, but never with more than a paragraph or
  two. Skimming helps you reach to a decision point: Does this book deserve
  more of my time and attention? If not, you put it down.

* **Superficial reading —** This is when you just read. Don’t ponder the
  argument, don’t look things up, don’t write in the margins. If you don’t
  understand something, move on. What you gain from this quick read will help
  you later when you go back and put more effort into reading. You now come to
  another decision point. Now that you have a better understanding of the
  book’s contents and its structure, do you want to understand it?

Inspectional reading gives you the gist of things.

Sometimes that’s all we want or need. But sometimes we want more. Sometimes we
want to understand.

## 3. Analytical Reading

Francis Bacon once remarked, “some books are to be tasted, others to be
swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.”

You can think of analytical reading as doing that chewing and digesting. This
is doing the work.

Analytical reading is a thorough reading.

If inspectional reading is the best you can do quickly, this is the best
reading you can do given time.

At this point, you start to engage your mind and dig into the work required to
understand what’s being said. I highly recommend you [use marginalia to
converse with the author](https://fs.blog/2015/01/marginalia/).

**There are four rules to Analytical Reading**
* Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.
* State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity.
* Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these
  parts as you have outlined the whole.
* Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve.

You’ll probably notice that while those sound pretty easy, they involve a lot
of work. Luckily the inspectional reading you’ve already done has primed you
for this.

After an inspectional read, you will understand the book and the author’s
views.

But that doesn’t mean you’ll understand the broader subject. To do that, you
need to use comparative reading to synthesize knowledge from several books on
the same subject.

## 4. Syntopical Reading

This is also known as comparative reading, and it represents the most demanding
and difficult reading of all. Syntopical Reading involves reading many books on
the same subject and comparing and contrasting ideas, vocabulary, and
arguments.

This task is undertaken by identifying relevant passages, translating the
terminology, framing and ordering the questions that need answering, defining
the issues, and having a conversation with the responses.

The goal is not to achieve an overall understanding of any _particular_ book,
but rather to understand the subject and develop a deep fluency.

This is all about identifying and filling in your knowledge gaps.

There are five steps to syntopical reading:

* **Finding the Relevant Passages -** You need to find the right books and then
  the passages that are most relevant to filling your needs. So the first step
  is an inspectional reading of all the works that you have identified as
  relevant.
* **Bringing the Author to Terms -** In analytical reading, you must identify
  the keywords and how they are used by the author. This is fairly
  straightforward. The process becomes more complicated now as each author has
  probably used different terms and concepts to frame their argument. Now the
  onus is on you to establish the terms. Rather than using the author’s
  language, you must use your own. In short, this is an exercise in translation
  and synthesis.
* **Getting the Questions Clear -** Rather than focus on the problems the
  author is trying to solve, you need to focus on the questions that you want
  answered. Just as we must establish our own terminology, so too must we
  establish our own propositions by shedding light on our problems to which the
  authors provide answers. It’s important to frame the questions in such a way
  that all or most of the authors can be interpreted as providing answers.
  Sometimes we might not get an answer to our questions because they might not
  have been seen as questions by the authors.
* **Defining the Issues -** If you’ve asked a clear question to which there are
  multiple answers then an issue has been defined. Opposing answers, now
  translated into your terms, must be ordered in relation to one another.
  Understanding multiple perspectives within an issue helps you [form an
  intelligent
  opinion](https://fs.blog/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/).
* **Analyzing the Discussion -** It’s presumptuous to expect we’ll find a
  single unchallenged truth to any of our questions. Our answer is the conflict
  of opposing answers. The value is the discussion you have with these authors.
  You can now have an informed opinion.

## Becoming a Demanding Reader

Reading is all about asking the right questions in the right order and seeking
answers.

There are four main questions you need to ask of every book:
* What is this book about?
* What is being said in detail, and how?
* Is this book true in whole or in part?
* What of it?

If all of this sounds like hard work, you’re right. Most people won’t do it.
That’s what sets you apart.
