# Opening questions for team meetings

From https://www.discprofiles.com/blog/2018/11/opening-questions-for-team-meetings/

Not everyone loves meetings. They can be made more engaging by preparing an
opening question. It can be an ice breaker for newly formed groups or something
to warm up the individuals in the group. It can help the quieter members of a
group get more used to speaking up. Good questions are a way of bringing
everyone’s attention to the present moment and to the group. It can also be a
way of mining for issues that might be obscured by the normal functioning of
the group.

No matter what the reason for opening a meeting with a question, the sharing
and discussion that follows will contribute to better relationships and better
understanding among the team members.
