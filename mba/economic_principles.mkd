# How the Economic Machine Works in 30 Mins

http://economicprinciples.org/

## 3 Main Forces

1. Productiviy Growth
2. Short term debt Cycle
3. Long term debt cycle

## Transactions

Credit spends just like money `Money + Credit spend = Total spending`

Total spending drives the economy

`Total Quantity = goods + services + financial assets`

`Price = Total spending / Total Quantity`

All cycles in economy are driven by transactions

Market = group of buyers and sellers transacting on single thing e.g. wheat, stock, etc

Govt is bigger buyer

Central bank controls interest rates and prints money
- controls credit

## Credit

Credit is biggest and most volatile part of economy

Borrow = principal + pay back interest

Borrowing increases when interest rates are low

## Credit vs Debt

As soon as credit is created (a borrowing transaction occurs), it converts to **debt**

**Spending drives the economy**

Creating credit => income for someone else

Creditworthy borrower has 2 things:
- ability to repay
- collateral if he can't

Increased income => increased borrowing => increased spending

## Cycles

`Productivity Growth = GDP growth over time`

- Productivity matters in long run
- Credt matters in short run

Debt:
- allows us to consume more than we produce when we acquire it
- forces us to consume less than we produce when we have to pay it back

Debt swings occur in 2 cycles
- 5-8 years
- 75-100 years

Swings driven by credit, not productivity

Cycles occur because we borrow
- when we borrow we create a time in the future where we have to spend less to pay back debt

## Economy with/without Credit

When purchasing on credit 2 things are created:
- asset
- liability

Money == Credit

Current US economy
- 50T credit
- 3T total money

- In an economy without credit the only way to increase income is to increase productivity
- In an economy **with credit** you can also increase spending by borrowing

Economy with credit allows increased spending over short term **but not over long run**

- Credit is bad when it finances overspending e.g. buying a tv
- Credit is good when it finances increased productivity e.g. buying a tractor

                    Credit
                   /      \
             Income        Spending
                   \      /
                 Productivity

e.g. everyone on avg has 100k income and borrows 10% of income
- P1 has 100k income and borrows 10k for total of 110k spend; buys goods from P2
- P2 now has 110k income and borrows 11k for total of 121k spend; buys goods from P3
- P3 now has 121k income and borrows 12.1k for total of 133.1k spend; buys goods from P4
- etc

This series of transactions is self reinforcing and drives growth for everyone down the line

## Inflation

**Borrowing creates cycles**
- as spending increases, prices rise since they're driven by credit

**Inflation** =  when the amount of spending and incomes grows faster than production of goods prices rise

Central bank doesn't want too much inflation.
- When prices rise they raise interest rates => fewer people can afford to borrow money
- since people have less credit, spending goes down driving prices down
- when inflation is lowered, bank lowers interest rates

short term debt cycle driven by lenders & borrowers willingness to receive credit
- when credit is available there's an **expansion**
- when credit is **not** easily available there's an **recesion**
- this is controlled by central bank (interest rates)

Each cycle ends with a peak for expansion but **also overall more debt**

It's human nature to want to spend instead of paying back debt
- this causes debts to grow faster than incomes
- drive **long term debt cycle**

Lenders more freely extend credit despite debt carried because they assume things are going great
- this drives the **bubble**

`debt burden = ration of debt to income`

## Deleveraging

Over decades debt burden increases faster than incomes
- my spending drives someone elses income

**long term debt peak**
- happened in west in 2008
- happened in japan in 90s

Economy starts **deleveraging**
- spending lowers
- banks tighten borrowing
- stock markets crash
- assets lower in value e.g. housing price
- credit starts to disappear

Deleveraging == less spending -> less income -> less wealth -> less credit -> less borrowing -> less spending

Unlike in a recession, lowering interest rates doesn't help during deleveraging since interest rates are already as low as they can get
- US interest 0% in 1930s and 2008

The following typically happens during deleveraging
1. **Austerity**: People and govts reduce spending
2. **debt restructuring**: debts are reduced thru defaults and restructuring
3. wealth is redistributed from haves to have-nots
4. central bank prints more money

Idea behind austerity is to focus on repaying debt. But since income falls faster than debt repayment the debt/income ratio gets worse
- Businesses cut losses => fewer jobs
- when borrower can't pay back bank, public loses trust in bank and want their cash back

Debt restructuring:
- paid back less
- paid back over longer time frame
- paid back at lower interest rate than originally agreed upon

Debt restructing drives income and asset values to disappear faster = debt burden ratio gets worse

Govt tries to stimulate economy via increased spending:
- this means govt is spending more than they earn in taxes
- need to raise taxes or borrow money
- govt naturally raise taxes on wealthy

The above can lead to social disorder due to resenment between wealthy and poor

Since people want more money, central bank will print more money
- this only helps those who own financial assets
- cash can only buy financial assets
- printing too much money can drive rapid inflation e.g. Germany in 1930s

Policy makers have to balance the 4 steps to manage deleveraging
- can be beautiful or ugly
- has to **drive income to grow faster than debt**

Generally
- depressions last 2-3 years
- reflation lasts 7-10 years ie. **lost decade**

## 3 Rules of Thumb

Dont' have debt rise faster than income
- b'se debt burden will eventually crush you

Dont' have income rise faster than productivity
- b'se you'll eventually become uncompetitive

Do all that you can to raise your productivity; this matters most in long run
