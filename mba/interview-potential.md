Interviewing for Potential

- Why are you better now at what you do compared to six months ago? 
  - Determine how they have increased their potential. The best answers are about being wise
r. Acquiring knowledge/skills is the first step. Leveraging that knowledge/skill is the second. Converting knowledge and experience to wisdom is the final s
tep.
  - Learning from one’s failures can also make someone better at what they do. If you don’t learn from your mistakes, you’re doomed to repeat them. Being be
  tter isn’t just about successes.
- What are you currently working on getting better at?
  - Knowing their biggest weakness only matters if they are doing something about it. The second part to this question is asking how it will make them more
  effective. They should be able to articulate how their efforts will have an impact.
- Tell me about the last article/video/talk that really intrigued you.
  - See if they are leveraging the community to increase their potential. This should reveal curiosity, initiative, and proactive learning.
- What do people come to you for help/advice about?
  - See if they are increasing the potential of others. For junior level candidates you could ask what they go to others for. Being able to ask for help/adv
  ice is a skill often overlooked.
- Do they have the ability to say “I don’t know?”
  - If they can’t say “I don’t know,” they probably won’t ask for help, and their potential is limited. As the interviewer, you should be able to come up wi
  th a question about some esoteric but interesting piece of knowledge. They should show curiosity as to what the answer is. The worst candidates show arrog
  ance and hubris.
- Why is your team better because you are on it?
  - A team that collaborates has high collective intelligence and thus high collective potential. The best answer will be about how they contribute to the t
  eam rather than how they personally elevate it.
  - Junior level candidates do make a team better; otherwise why are they on the team? At the very least they increase the capacity of the team.

Plotting a Trajectory
- Why are you going to be better at what you do six months from now?
  - See if they are aware of the trajectory they are on and if it’s the right trajectory. Similar to the potential question, the best answer will explain ho
  w they will leverage and apply what they are getting better at.
  - Becoming a better cook doesn’t matter unless you’re going to cook.
- What was the last thing you learned about yourself that you didn’t know before?
  - This reveals how self-aware they are as well as how their trajectory has helped them grow. Even simple answers (“I don’t like mushrooms”) can be reveali
  ng. They’ve known themselves all their life; why did it take them so long? Delve into how they came to their realization.
- What would you have done differently on a recent project?
  - See if they have been learning and gaining wisdom. Nobody is perfect; they should know that. They should be able to reflect, analyze, and critique their
   own work.
- What is your trajectory? What was your last course correction and why?
  - A bit more in depth than “why did you leave your last job?”. For junior candidates and interns their course correction may be their major in school.
- You’re only as good as your next accomplishment. What are you accomplishing next?
  - The best answers articulate a vision and/or strategy. The more interesting answers aren’t related to their career, but are still revealing. Perhaps they
   are going to take Improv classes so that they can learn to be comfortable speaking in front of a room (i.e. leading meetings).

Performance
- Describe a part of a project that you owned. How did you measure success?
  - There is a big difference between following specifications and taking ownership. One doesn’t have to have own a project to take ownership of their part.

  - People with a sense of ownership will be able to articulate what the project is, why it is important, and how it will have an impact.
- Is success defined by completing tasks or the impact of those tasks? Output vs outcome.
- Describe a project that was not a success. Who is to blame for that lack of success?
  - The correct answer is that everyone involved contributed to the lack of success. Bonus points for saying blaming is not productive. The use of the word
  “blame” is purposeful in this question.
- Which is more important building things right or building the right thing?
  - The correct answer is that it depends. See if they have the right perspective. Security and transactions are always about building things right. MVPs ar
  e about figuring out the right things to build.
- Why are you effective at your job?
  - See if they describe being productive or effective. The best answers mention teamwork and influence. Junior and senior level people are effective in dif
  ferent ways.
- What is a bad way to implement X?
  - See if they know what not to do. Test for practical intelligence. We’ve all done something that seemed like a good approach at the time, but eventually
  proved to be incorrect (i.e. anti-patterns).
