Qn: Why can't we accept feedback without wanting to engage/respond?

What makes feedback so hard?
- We want to learn and grow
- We also want to be accepted or respected the way we are now

3 types of feeback                                                                  - Appreciation: "I notice you. I get you. You matter"
- Coaching: "Here's how you can improve..."
- Evaluation: "Here's where you stand, and what to expect"

At SF, we tend to do Appreciation (Ohana) and less Coaching and evaluation

How do I get more of what I want?
- What type of feedback would you like more of?
- How might you get it?
- Who might you ask?

Ways to ask for feeback:
- Appreciation: What's working that you'd like me to continue?
- Coaching: What's one thing you see me doing or failing to do that's getting
  in my own way?
- Evaluation: How am I doing based on your expectation of where I'd be by now?

Make sure to encourage more feedback by responding with appreciation to the
feedback and letting the person know you're acting on the feedback

3 triggered reactions
- Truth triggers: "you're wrong"
  - the challenge to SEE
- Relationship triggers: "who are you to tell me"
  - the challenge of WE
- Identity triggers: "Aaaaaaahhhhh!"
  - the challenge of BEING ME

Unpack labels
- Where is the feeback coming from? Situation? Behavior? Impact?

It is your responsibility as the feedback receiver, whether you accept or
reject it, to at least consider the feedback and be thoughtful about it.

Feedback framework
- Coming from?
- Receiver?
- Going to?

Be specific: situation, behavior, impact

Qn: on a scale of 1-5 (1 under-sensitive, 5 super-sensitive) how sensitive are you?

If under-sensitve to feedback... we mayu not realize people are trying to give us feedback
- my partner is under-sensitive so I have to be super direct "please unload the
  dishwasher"
- even when we get it, we don't remember the feedback unless it's emotional

If highly-sensitive to feedback
- Google bias: we search for all the reasons we are a bad person
- One thing is everything: "i'm completely incompetent and can't focus on
  anything else"
- Doom zoom: "It's hopeless, I'll never get better. I'll die alone"

Sample Guide to Working with Me (A non-definitive instructional guide)

When, where, how
- Tell me 1:1, and preferably out of ear shot of anyone else
  - tell me sooner rather than later, but not in the moment
  - Don't stop the session to tell me what I can do differently
  - Tell me during a break or after the meeting
- Give me
  - Time to process the information
  - space to follow up with you
- Ask me about my perspsective
  - what was your intention?
  - were you aware?

My Wiring
- I have short positive sustain, so frequent positive, specific and genuine
  feedbac is helpful
- Unless you're related to me by blood, I will recover from negative feedback
  form you within 24 hours.
- By recover I mean stop crying and have figured out something tangible to
  experiment with

(similar to Love Lanaguges) Please...
- Show appreciation: Love languages include quality time and acts of service...
- Give me coaching, I'll figure out what to do with it...
