## Dysfunction #1: Absence of Trust

**The fear of being vulnerable with team members prevents the building of trust
within the team.**

> Trust is knowing that when a team member does push you, they’re doing it
> because they care about the team (Lencioni).

The concept of trust amongst teams boils down to vulnerability. It “is the
confidence among team members that their peers’ intentions are good, and that
there is no reason to be protective or careful around the group.” This is
different from _reliance_ where you might ‘trust’ someone to always do good
work based on their track record.

Vulnerability is vital here because it is the indicator that trust is high
enough that people are no longer worried about protecting themselves. Most
people have difficulty admitting their weaknesses and faults because of the
competitive instincts we develop at work. People are constantly trying to
protect their reputations, CYA, and cast blame on others when a mistake is
made. There are tons of cliches passed off as vital career advice that
encourage you to put yourself before others “look out for number one” and
“never let them see you sweat” (5 Dysfunctions Field Guide).

> Teams that lack trust waste inordinate amounts of time and energy managing
> behaviors and interactions within the group (5 Dysfunctions).

For trust to work, leaders must not only show vulnerability first, but create
an environment that does not punish it.

> If we don’t trust one another, then we aren’t going to engage in open,
> constructive, ideological conflict. And we’ll just continue to preserve a
> sense of artificial harmony (Lencioni).

Lencioni gives the following characteristics to look for in a team:

**Members of teams with an absence of trust…**
- Conceal their weaknesses and mistakes from one another
- Hesitate to ask for help or provide constructive feedback
- Hesitate to offer help outside their own areas of responsibility
- Jump to conclusions about the intentions and aptitudes of others without attempting to clarify them
- Fail to recognize and tap into one another’s skills and experiences
- Hold grudges
- Dread meetings and find reasons to avoid spending time together

**Members of trusting teams…**

- Admit weaknesses and mistakes
- Ask for help
- Accept questions and input about their areas of responsibility
- Give one another the benefit of the doubt before arriving at a negative conclusion
- Take risks in offering feedback and assistance
- Appreciate and tap into one another’s skills and experiences
- Focus time and energy on important issues, not politics
- Offer and accept apologies without hesitation
- Look forward to meetings and other opportunities to work as a group

**So what do you do if your team is dealing with a lack of trust?**

Here are some of the suggestions offered.

**PDF [Personal Histories](http://usmanconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Personal_Histories_Exercise.pdf)**
This helps team members relate to each other on a more personal basis. The core
of empathy and understanding is seeing each other as humans. Too often, we work
with people who we know very little about. This means even a little bit of
insight into a person can help break down large barriers. Revealing even small
things about your personal life can help make someone comfortable opening up
about other things (such as bigger vulnerabilities). This creates a gradual
process of building trust.

Another thing Lencioni highlights in regards to this exercise is the
_Fundamental Attribution Error_. This means that we usually think others do bad
things because they’re naturally predisposed to do them, but when _we_ do bad
things it is because of being in a tough spot or situation. Similarly, when
we do something good, we assume it is due to our inherent capabilities. When
others do well, we attribute it to a situation or luck.

The more team members learn about each other, the more they are able to
empathize with them. For example, a person may have gone through a traumatic
experience in another career or business, and this shapes how they now make
decisions. A little bit of understanding helps create the flexibility to have a
more trusting team.

**PDF [Team Effectiveness Exercise](http://usmanconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Team_Effectiveness_Exercise.pdf)**
This one requires a higher level of trust than the personal histories exercise,
but is effective. It gives team members a forum for providing each other with
direct and actionable feedback on how their individual performance can improve
the performance of the team.

**Personality Profiles** Lencioni recommends utilizing the [Myers
Briggs](http://Team Effectiveness Exercise (PDF)) test. There are lots of tests
out there that serve a similar purpose. The idea here is to provide a
vocabulary for describing differences and similarities that make it safe to
give each other feedback (instead of sounding like unfounded generalizations).
I personally recommend the [DISC
profile](https://www.discprofile.com/what-is-disc/overview/) assessment. This
helps you understand how people think and approach things. For example, it lets
you identify who is a big picture person and who is a detail oriented person.
This better equips leaders with understanding _how_ to talk to people of
different personality types and make sure they are empowered with the type of
information they need to be successful.

Review)](https://hbr.org/2014/12/what-bosses-gain-by-being-vulnerable) 
“Vulnerability here does not mean being weak or submissive. To the contrary, it
implies the courage to be yourself. It means replacing “professional distance
and cool” with uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure. Opportunities for
vulnerability present themselves to us at work every day. Examples she gives of
vulnerability include calling an employee or colleague whose child is not well,
reaching out to someone who has just had a loss in their family, asking someone
for help, taking responsibility for something that went wrong at work, or
sitting by the bedside of a colleague or employee with a terminal illness.”

[Expressing Your Vulnerability Makes You Stronger (Harvard Business
Review)](https://hbr.org/2014/07/expressing-your-vulnerability-makes-you-stronger/)
“By humbling myself with an apology and reaching out to this fellow coach and
dad, I realized that I was taking a leadership step that I encourage in my
clients. When angry or fearful, step back and be self-reflective. Don’t vilify
your boss or co-workers or employees or competitors. Strive to put yourself in
the shoes of your perceived adversary. Avoid impulsive statements and actions.
Express regret or apology. Gain strength by allowing yourself to be humble and
vulnerable.”

and team.”

## Dysfunction #2: Fear of Conflict

**The desire to preserve artificial harmony stifles the occurrence of
productive ideological conflict.**

In short, it becomes impossible to hash out an idea based on its merit.

It is important to delineate between conflict over concepts and conflict that
is personal. Good conflict does not encompass politics, insults, or personal
comments. It _does_ include passionate and emotional debate over ideas. Healthy
conflict is the happy medium between artificial harmony and mean-spirited
personal attacks.

Good conflict is not about winning a debate, it is about listening to someone
else’s ideas and considering their point of view.

> Great teams do not hold back with one another. They are unafraid to air their
> dirty laundry. They admit their mistakes, their weaknesses, and their
> concerns without fear of reprisal (Lencioni).

Most people avoid this in order to try to keep some sense of harmony. Instead,
it results in tension where people are not able to openly speak up. This ends
up creating more politics and the formation of cliques.

> It’s as simple as this. When people don’t unload their opinions and feel like
> they’ve been listened to, they won’t really get on board (Lencioni).

Many companies end up indirectly encouraging this kind of behavior when they
throw around cliches like “take that issue offline” or moving something behind
closed doors.

This doesn’t mean things are always smooth sailing. Feathers should get ruffled
(in the scope of the discussion), but it is the only way to make the best
decision to move forward.

Lencioni gives the following characteristics to look for:

**Teams that fear conflict…**
- Have boring meetings
- Create environments where back-channel politics and personal attacks thrive
- Ignore controversial topics that are critical to team success
- Fail to tap into all the opinions and perspectives of team members
- Waste time and energy with posturing and interpersonal risk management

**Teams that engage in conflict…**
- Have lively, interesting meetings
- Extract and exploit the ideas of all team members
- Solve real problems quickly
- Minimize politics
- Put critical topics on the table for discussion

**How do you overcome fear of conflict?**

Simply identifying what is positive conflict and acknowledging that it is
productive can go a long way. It is also important to look for buried
disagreements and try to bring them to light. This forces the team to start
working through them.

Lencioni recommends looking at the [Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode
Instrument](https://www.cpp.com/products/tki/index.aspx) (TKI).

There is also a Depth-Frequency Conflict Model that gives feedback on how team
members assess conflict tendencies and identify areas for improvement. This can
be found in the [Facilitator’s Field Guide](http://amzn.to/1PyNaFg).

[Conflict Keeps Teams at the Top of Their Game (Harvard Business
Review)](https://hbr.org/2012/07/conflict-keeps-teams-at-the-to)  “if only
organizations would spend as much time and effort on making their teams feel
“psychologically safe” as they currently do on instructing people to be “team
players”, they would likely be far better off as a result. In workplaces where
people self-censor for fear of being perceived as negative or incompetent or
“not a team player”, collaboration will not come as naturally. Human beings are
social animals. And so our priorities may have been wrong all along. We must
focus on creating safe spaces for people to express themselves and take risks.
If we do this well, teamwork will be a no-brainer by comparison.”

[Supporting Healthy Conflict in the Workplace

- “It means you have a variety of personality types, each with their own way of
  approaching problems and solving them to ensure business success. It also
  means you have team members with vastly different ways of communicating,
  working within a team, dealing with pressure and even differences in
  perception of what is a problem and what isn’t.”

[The Trouble With Teamwork
(Lencioni)](http://www.tablegroup.com/blog/drucker-foundations-leader-to-leader-no-29-the-trouble-with-teamwork)
- “CEOs who go to great lengths to avoid conflict often do so believing that
  they are strengthening their teams by avoiding destructive disagreement. This
  is ironic, because what they are really doing is sti- fling productive
  conflict and pushing important issues that need to be resolved under the
  carpet where they will fester. Eventually, those unresolved issues transform
  into uglier and more personal discord when executives grow frustrated at what
  they perceive to be repeated problems. What CEOs and their teams must do is
  learn to identify artificial harmony when they see it, and incite productive
  conflict in its place.This is a messy process, one that takes time to master.
  But there is no avoiding it, because to do so makes it next to impossible for
  a team to make real commitment.”

[NBA Sterling Drama: The Perils of Avoiding Conflict Within Your Team (Inc.
Magazine)](http://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/nba-sterling-conflict.html)  “If
there’s a latent conflict or tension in your organization, you need to bring it

pushing it under the carpet. It will come back to bite you, and your

- “From top to bottom, San Antonio always employs a stellar coaching staff that
  isn’t afraid to challenge what Pop says. Sideline reporters might be
  terrified of his gruff answers during mid-game interviews, but coaches are
  presumably more scared by what he’ll do if they don’t add to the
  conversation. Some coaches hire plenty of yes-men as assistant coaches, guys
  who won’t challenge anything said by the man in charge.”

- ““Alvin sees it from an offensive perspective; Ron sees everything from a
  defensive perspective,” Kerr said. “I believe Ron would like to win a game
  4-2\. And I don’t think Alvin would mind winning 138-130.” The sessions are
  spirited, especially when the season is on the line. But all of the
  principals say there are no major disagreements, just debate and questions
  and more debate. As Collins said, if you have a point, you have to be able to
  defend it.”

[Conflict: An Important Dimension in Successful Management
Teams](http://usmanconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Amason-Conflict.pdf)
- “Unlike C-type conflict, A-type conflict undermines team effectiveness by
  preventing teams from engaging in the kinds of activities that are critical
  to team effectiveness. A-type conflict fosters cynicism, distrust, and
  avoidance, thereby obstructing open communication and integration. When that
  happens, not only does the quality of solutions decline, but commitment to
  the team itself erodes because team members no longer associate themselves
  with the team’s actions.”

## Dysfunction #3: Lack of Commitment

**The lack of clarity or buy-in prevents team members from making decisions
they will stick to.**

Commitment builds on the first two dysfunctions. You need trust to produce
productive conflict. Productive conflict then enables people to commit with
clarity and buy-in.

Seeking consensus is a natural inclination but a big mistake. Many times
consensus is sought as a form of CYA or a cover for analysis paralysis. People
want to get everyone on record as agreeing so that blame can be diffused if
something goes wrong. Great teams know that consensus is impossible (and works
against productive conflict).

It is better to take input and commit to a course of action  even if there is
uncertainty involved  than it is to waffle back and forth. Commitment having
clarity and buy-in simply means the removal of assumptions and ambiguities, and
honest emotional support. Commitment, in fact, would be buying in even if you
don’t agree with a decision (i.e. breaking consensus).

> Most reasonable people don’t have to get their way in a discussion. They just
> need to be heard, and to know that their input was considered and responded
> to (Lencioni).

This point is vital because it is a primary cause of politics. When people do
not feel heard, if a decision fails, they will go around saying, “I told you
so.”

> Politics is when people choose their words and actions based on how they want
> others to react rather than based on what they really think (Lencioni).

Lencioni gives the following characteristics to look for:

**A team that fails to commit…**
- Creates ambiguity among the team about direction and priorities
- Watches windows of opportunity close due to excessive analysis and unnecessary delay
- Breeds lack of confidence and fear of failure
- Revisits discussions and decisions again and again
- Encourages second-guessing among team members

**A team that commits…**
- Creates clarity around direction and priorities
- Aligns the entire team around common objectives
- Develops an ability to learn from mistakes
- Takes advantage of opportunities before competitors do
- Moves forward without hesitation
- Changes direction without hesitation or guilt

**How do you overcome lack of commitment?**

The primary technique here is cascading communication. This means leaders must
go out and communicate the results to their teams. When forced to explain
something to employees, they’ll make sure all concerns are aired (healthy
conflict). It also ensures everyone is on the same page. When leaders are on
the same page and all go out and communicate the same message, it sends a
powerful message to employees.

Setting deadlines for decisions and creating worst-case scenario contingencies
also helps create commitment to decisions. The biggest challenge for a leader
in this situation is being okay with making a decision that may ultimately be
wrong.

question raised by this case of course is why our manager didn’t start by
convening all of the interested stakeholders in the first place. The easy
answer perhaps is that she didn’t think of it, or didn’t realize that she had
the authority. But the deeper reason, which is true for many managers, is the
perception that convening people outside of your own hierarchy is risky and
difficult. As a result, many managers unconsciously avoid taking this step.”

  thinking.”

[Communication Needs to ‘Cascade’ From the Executive Suite
(Lencioni)](http://www.tablegroup.com/newsroom/news/communication-needs-to-cascade-from-executive-suite)
“Members of an organization’s executive team leave each of their meetings
having agreed on a common set of messages that they will communicate to their
respective staffs within a set period of time, usually between 24 and 48 hours
after the end of the meeting. Then, members of their staffs communicate those
same messages to their staffs, and so on until they have cascaded throughout
much or all of the organization. While the depth that is reached by cascading
communication varies depending on the size and structure of an organization, in
most cases it manages to descend two or three levels below the executive team.
But what is important is that messages are being communicated consistently and
quickly in a personal way.”

**PDF** [Cascading Communication
Exercise](http://usmanconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Cascading_Communication_Exercise.pdf)
- ” Cascading communication provides a great opportunity to establish clarity
  in an organization. When employees in different parts of an organization hear
  their leaders saying the same things after meetings, they start to believe
  that alignment and clarity is real and present in the organization.”

## Dysfunction #4: Avoidance of Accountability

**The need to avoid interpersonal discomfort prevents team members from holding
one another accountable.**

Once there is a clear sense of what is expected, teammates are enabled to hold
one another accountable. They have to be able to call peers out on performance
or behaviors that may harm the team. The irony of holding back on this out of
fear of discomfort is that eroding performance actually creates more resentment
between people.

This doesn’t happen immediately, but fades over time as standards slowly
decline.

Holding people accountable for results only is not enough, behaviors must be
included  they often precede results issues.

> Once we achieve clarity and buy-in, it is then that we have to hold each
> other accountable for what we sign up to do, for high standards of
> performance and behavior. And as simple as that sounds, most executives hate
> to do it, especially when it comes to a peer’s behavior (Lencioni).

Lencioni gives the following characteristics to look for:

**A team that avoids accountability…**
- Creates resentment among team members who have different standards of performance
- Encourages mediocrity
- Misses deadlines and key deliverables
- Places an undue burden on the team leader as the sole source of discipline

**A team that holds one another accountable…**
- Ensures that poor perfromers feel pressure to improve
- Identifies potential problems quickly by questioning one another’s approaches without hesitation
- Establishes respect among team members who are held to the same high standards
- Avoids excessive bureaucracy around performance management and corrective action

**How do you create a culture of accountability?**
The enemy of accountability is ambiguity. Publishing clear goals and standards is vital to set expectations. Setting team goals and team rewards helps here as well. People are less likely to watch someone fail if the entire team has a stake.

**PDF** [Team Effectiveness
Exercise](http://usmanconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Team_Effectiveness_Exercise1.pdf)
- Gives team members a forum to provide one another with focused, direct, and
  actionable feedback about how their individual behavior can improve the
  performance of the team. This is recommended for teams that have already
  built some trust and have been together for at least a couple of months (so
  they have observation-based opinions of one another).

## Dysfunction #5: Inattention to Results

**The pursuit of individual goals and personal status erodes the focus on collective success.**

Without accountability, people will gravitate toward their own personal goals at the expense of the collective goals of the team. Sports analogies fit in well here. It’s like a basketball player being happy he got a triple-double even if the team lost.

It is important to clearly define the results. A team member must be able to look at the results and know if they met the target. Many teams falter by setting subjective goals.

> Make the results that we need to achieve so clear that no one would even consider doing something purely to enhance his or her individual status or ego. Because that would diminish our ability to achieve our collective goals. We would all lose (Lencioni).

Lencioni gives the following characteristics to look for:

**A team that is not focused on results…**

- Stagnates/fails to grow
- Rarely defeats competitors
- Loses achievement-oriented employees
- Encourages team members to focus on their own careers and individual goals
- Is easily distracted

**A team that focuses on collective results…**

- Retains achievement-oriented employees
- Minimizes individualistic behavior
- Enjoys success and suffers failure acutely
- Benefits from individuals who subjugate their own goals/interests for the good of the team
- Avoids distractions

**How do teams stay results focused?**

One important tool is having a scoreboard of some sort. Have some kind of metrics that people can look at and quickly understand whether or not the team is succeeding. Publicly declare the goals, and reward the team based on achieving those results.
