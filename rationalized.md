The body cannot crave nicotine. **Only the brain can crave**. 

The addiction is 1% physical, and **99% mental**

If you do begin to feel uncomfortable, slow your breathing down and take a
couple of nice, big, deep breaths. Focus on the key thoughts: 
- **there is nothing to ‘give up’ apart from a life of fear, misery and
  slavery** 
- **every smoker is envious of you** as a non-smoker, because every smoker
  would rather be a non-smoker; 
- that the **little monster is dead** or already dying. 

1. **Realize that you can do this. There is nothing different about you that
   makes quitting uniquely challenging.** Millions of Americans have done it,
   and you can too. The only person who can make you smoke that next cigarette
   is you.
2. **There is absolutely nothing to give up. On the contrary, there are
   enormous positive gains to be made.** I do not only mean you will be
   healthier and wealthier. I mean that you will be able to enjoy the good
   times more and that your ability to cope during the bad times will improve.
3. **Get it clear in your mind that there is no such thing as one cigarette.**
   Smoking is drug addiction and a chain reaction. The first cigarette you ever
   smoked is responsible for every one you have ever smoked.
4. **See smoking for what it really is. It is not a sociable habit with some
   unfortunate side effects. It is drug addiction and a disease.** Face up to
   the fact that, whether you like it or not, YOU HAVE GOT THIS DISEASE. It
   won’t go away just because you bury your head in the sand.  Remember: like
   all progressive diseases, it gets worse and worse. The easiest and best time
   to rid yourself of this disease is now.
5. **Separate the disease (i.e. the chemical addiction) from the frame of mind
   of being a smoker or a non-smoker.** All smokers, if given the opportunity
   to go back to the time before they became hooked, would jump at that
   opportunity and choose a non-smoking life. You have that opportunity today!
   Embrace it!  Don’t even think about it as ‘giving up’ smoking. As soon as
   you make the decision to smoke your final cigarette you become a non-smoker.
   You should celebrate right from the outset, and you should continue to
   celebrate for the rest of your life.

**Tobacco is the only legal product that if used precisely as the manufacturer
intended, kills you**.
1. **Keep this book safely in a place where you can easily refer to it.** Do
   not lose it, lend it out or give it away. It’s no bad thing to pick it up
   occasionally and read a couple of pages. It’ll keep you ‘in the zone’. This
   is your shortcut to attaining the right frame of mind about smoking. Keep it
   close at hand, in case you need it. Rather than lend it out (trust me—you’ll
   never get it back) gift copies to any friends who show an interest in it.
2. **If you ever find yourself envying a smoker, realize that they will be
   envious of you.** You are not being deprived. They are.
3. **Remember you did not enjoy being a smoker. That’s why you stopped.** You
   do enjoy being a non-smoker.
4. **Remember, there is no such thing as just one cigarette**.
5. **Never doubt your decision never to smoke again. You know it’s the correct
   decision**.

If you have a feeling of doom and gloom, it will be for one of the following
reasons.
1. **Something has not quite ‘clicked’ in your mind**. Re-read the above five
   points and ask yourself if you genuinely believe them to be true. If you
   doubt any point, re-read the appropriate chapter or chapters.
2. **You fear failure itself**. Do not worry. Just read on. You will succeed.
   The whole business of smoking is like a confidence trick on a grand scale.
   Intelligent people do fall for confidence tricks, but only once. Having seen
   through the smoking illusions, you will not fall for the same con trick
   again so you should have no fear of failure.
3. **You agree with everything, but you are still miserable. Don’t be! Open
   your eyes. Something wonderful is happening**. You are about to escape from
   the prison. Anyway, it is the cigarette that is causing the
   misery—non-smokers aren’t miserable when they can’t smoke!

You are making the most rational decision you've ever made.

am a non-smoker!`
