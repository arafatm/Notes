## WARM-UPS AND STRETCHES

### DYNAMIC WARM-UPS

Warm-ups are not a race or a competition. They should focus on controlled
movements through thefullrangeofmotion.Takeverylittlerestbetween the movements.
By the end of the warm-up, you should feel slightly fatigued and you should
have broken a sweat.

- Five minutes: easy jog

10 REPS OF EACH OF THE FOLLOWING:
- Head turns, right and left
- Shoulder shrugs (up, back, down, forward and up, forward, down, back)
- Arm circles, front and back (small to large) 
- Back slaps
- Standing back bends
- Lateral standing side bends
- Standing leg swings from the hip (front and back, side to side)
- Ankle circles, right and left 
- Partial squat
- Partial lunge

### MOBILITY 1 | PERFORM 2–4 OF THESE STRETCHES

**Hamstring Stretch** | Stand with your legs wider than shoulder-width apart.
Lower yourself into a squat position and grab your toes. Slowly straighten out
the legs until you feel tension in the hamstrings. Hold for 10 seconds. Drop
your hips back into the squat position and stand back up. Repeat 10 times.

**Glute Stretch** | Lie on your back with your feet flat and knees bent. Raise
one knee up toward your chest, bringing the foot across to the outside of the
opposite leg and then grab the thigh of the “down leg” and pull it toward the
chest until you feel tension in the opposite hip. Repeat three times on each
side.

**Spiderman Stretch** | Get into a forward lunge position. Keep the back leg
straight and the forward leg bent at a 90-degree angle so the knee is over the
middle of the foot. Lower your hips into a deep lunge position. Start by
placing both hands on the ground by the forward foot. As your mobility
improves, try to bring the same elbow as the forward leg to the instep of the
foot. Hold for 30 seconds and then switch sides.

**Scapular Wall Slides** | Stand upright a few inches away from a wall with
your back against it. Raise your hands to shoulder height and bend your elbows
at a 90-degree angle. Face your palms away from the wall. Squeeze your shoulder
blades together and slide your hands up the wall to a straight arm position.
Try to keep your elbow in contact with the wall. Repeat three times

**The Frog** | Begin by kneeling on a mat or soft surface. Spread your knees
out wide and keep hips back. Keep the spine neutral and abdominals tight.
Inhale deeply through the nose and exhale through the mouth with pursed lips.
Hold for 30 seconds.
 
### MOBILITY 2 STRETCHES | PERFOM 2-3 OF THESE STRETCHES 

**Warrior Pose **| Get into the lunge position with the rear foot turned out.
Drop the hips until the forward thigh is parallel to the ground and extend the
arms directly overhead with the hands together. Keep the chest high up and the
head facing forward. Hold for 30 seconds and then switch sides. Repeat three
times.  

**Triangle Pose** | In the warrior pose, straighten both legs with the front foot
pointing forward and back foot pointing out. Reach down the forward leg as far
as possible with the same arm, ideally touching the ankle. Reach up with the
opposite arm so that both arms make a straight, vertical line (one reaching
toward the ground the other toward the sky). Hold for 15 seconds and then
switch sides. Repeat three times.

**Unilateral Hip Flex** | Stand with arms overhead or out to the side. Extend one
leg back and bend at your hips to lower your torso until your torso is parallel
to the ground and leg, respectively, as if you were trying to make yourself
longer. Breathe deeply to make your body longer and lighter. Hold for 15
seconds and then switch sides. Repeat three times.  HOW TO MAKE A 15–25 LB.
SANDBAG Equipment | 15–25 pounds of sand, two to three contractor or heavy-duty
trash bags, duct tape Put 15–25 pounds of sand into one of the trash bags. Let
the sand settle into one of the corners. Fold the trash bag in half the long
way and then roll the bag up from the bottom to the top pushing the air out as
you roll. Seal the top of the bag with bag inside a second bag and repeat the
procedure. A tighter roll will make the bag more stable and easier to handle.
If you desire a more dynamic and unstable sand bag, roll it a little bit
looser. Add a third bag for greater durability.  Or get one of our own Spartan
Pancakes at Shop.spartan.com.
